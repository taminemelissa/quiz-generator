The tapestry is annotated in Latin. It is exhibited in a special museum in Bayeux, Normandy called \"Mus\u00e9e de la Tapisserie de Bayeux\".\nThe tapestry tells the story of the Norman conquest of England. The two combatants are the Anglo-Saxon English, led by Harold Godwinson, recently crowned as King of England, and the Normans, led by William the Conqueror.\nThe tapestry is regarded as one of the greatest examples of Anglo-Saxon art, because, though ordered by a Norman, it was made by English (Anglo-Saxon) artisans. It is also extremely important as a historical document.\nIn common with other embroidered hangings of the early medieval period, this piece is conventionally referred to as a \"tapestry\", although it is not a true tapestry in which the design is woven into the cloth; it is in fact an embroidery.\nThe Bayeux tapestry is embroidered in wool yarn on a tabby-woven linen ground using two methods of stitching: outline or stem stitch for lettering and the outlines of figures, and couching or laid work for filling in figures. The linen is assembled in panels and has been patched in numerous places.\nThe main yarn colours are terracotta or russet, blue-green, dull gold, olive green, and blue, with small amounts of dark blue or black and sage green."}
{"id": "300513", "revid": "631927", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=300513", "title": "Anglo-Saxon Chronicle", "text": "The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle is a collection of annals in Old English chronicling the history of the Anglo-Saxons. The annals were initially created late in the 9th century, probably in Wessex, during the reign of Alfred the Great. Multiple manuscript copies were made and distributed to monasteries across England and were independently updated. In one case, the chronicle was still being actively updated in 1154.\nNine manuscripts survive in whole or in part, though not all are of equal historical value and none of them is the original version. The oldest seems to have been started towards the end of Alfred's reign, while the most recent was written at Peterborough Abbey after a fire at that monastery in 1116. \nAlmost all of the material in the chronicle is in the form of annals, by year; the earliest are dated at 60 BC, and historical material follows up to the year in which the chronicle was written, at which point contemporary records begin. These manuscripts collectively are known as the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\".\nThe Chronicle is not unbiased: there are occasions when comparison with other medieval sources makes it clear that the scribes who wrote it omitted events or told one-sided versions of stories; there are also places where the different versions contradict each other. \nTaken as a whole the Chronicle is the single most important historical source for the period in England between the end of Roman rule in Britain and the decades following the Norman Conquest. Much of the information given in the Chronicle is not recorded elsewhere. In addition, the manuscripts are important sources for the history of the English language; in particular, the later Peterborough Chronicle is one of the earliest examples of Middle English in existence.\nSeven of the nine surviving manuscripts and fragments are now in the British Library. The remaining two are in the Bodleian Library at Oxford and the Parker Library of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge."}

Gawler's father was a captain in the 73rd Regiment of Foot, and he was killed in Mysore, India in December 1804. The Gawler family came from Devon. George Gawler was educated by a private teacher, then at a school in Cold Bath, Islington. He spent two years at the military college in Great Marlow.\nIn October 1810 Gawler joined 52nd (Oxfordshire) Regiment of Foot as an ensign and in January 1812 he went to the Peninsular War. At Badajoz, Gawler was wounded during a charge, but he was saved from death by a soldier who lost his own life. He was in Spain until 1814, taking part in the advance on Madrid. The regiment returned to England and Gawler fought at the Battle of Waterloo as a lieutenant. He remained in France with the army of occupation until 1818, and in 1820 married Maria Cox of Derby who was the niece of Samuel Richardson. Gawler's new sister-in-law Mary Ann married William Leeke, a fellow officer from the 52nd. Gawler and his wife were sincerely religious. When the 52nd was sent to New Brunswick in 1823 they did much social and religious work. Gawler returned to England in 1826, and from 1830 to 1832 he was engaged in recruiting. He reached the rank of lieutenant-colonel in 1834, and in 1837 received the Royal Hanoverian Guelphic Order (KH), third class.\nIn 1838 Gawler was appointed governor of South Australia. His predecessor was Captain John Hindmarsh. Gawler and his wife and children arrived on the Pestonjee Bomanjee on 12 October 1838. They had made a four-month journey via Tenerife and Rio de Janeiro. Gawler found that the colony lacked public finances, and poor officials and 4000 immigrants were living in mean houses. He was allowed a maximum of \u00a312,000 expenditure a year, with an additional \u00a35,000 credit for emergencies. His first goal was to accelerate rural settlement and primary production. He persuaded Charles Sturt to come from New South Wales for surveying, because Colonel William Light who had performed the role resigned due to bad health. Gawler appointed more colonial officials, set up a police force, took part in exploration, and improved the facilities at Port Adelaide during his administration. The first permanent Government House was built and this is now the East Wing of the present building.\nIn 1840, droughts in other Australian colonies increased the cost of living rapidly because South Australia had not been self-sufficient for food yet. Gawler increased public expenditure but eventually the economy broke and the management policy of the colony was forced to change. Over \u00a3200,000 had been spent and the land fund in London had been exhausted. A \u00a3155,000 loan was approved by the British Parliament (later made a gift) and Captain George Grey was sent to replace Gawler.\nGovernor Gawler had managed to make South Australia self-sufficient in terms of agriculture and had restored public confidence. Gawler was a resolute and energetic officer. When he found the settlers faced with disaster, he judged at once what it was necessary to do, and saved the colony. However, Gawler's work was long misjudged, largely because his successor Grey unfairly criticised Gawler. Richard Charles Mills wrote in his \"Colonization of Australia\" that Gawler had been guilty of carelessness and wastefulness, and deserves blame. But at the same time Mills admitted that Gawler was facing extraordinary difficulties.\nCharles Sturt and other men at the time generally agreed that his administration had greatly benefited the settlement, and the select committee on South Australia reported that the critics of his expenditure were \"unable to point out any specific item by which it could have been considerably reduced without great public inconvenience\". Later investigations show that Gawler was surely one of founders of South Australia.\nLegacy.\nIn 1845, Gawler wrote a book in which he suggested that Jews be allowed to establish Jewish agricultural settlements in the Land of Israel as compensation for their suffering in Europe and under Turkish rule. In 1849 he toured Israel with Moses Montefiore. In 1852, he established an association for the colonization of Palestine. Gawler died in Southsea and was buried in Portsmouth.\nThe town of Gawler was named after him, as it was surveyed soon after he arrived. The Gawler Ranges at the north end of Eyre Peninsula are also named after him. Derby's Town and County Museum in the 1830s included Gawler in its list of principal benefactors. Gawler had contributed a collection of minerals and exotic stuffed birds which included an albatross from his time as governor."}

It is also an introduced species to Irian Jaya, Borneo (Kalimantan) the Lesser Sunda Islands, Maluku, Sulawesi, Australia, Mauritius, New Caledonia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, R\u00e9union.\nThe deer lives in a habitat similar to that of the Chital of India, that is, open dry and mixed deciduous forests, parklands, and savannas. It is a close relative of the larger sambar deer. It is hunted in eastern Australasia. Javan Rusa deer breed in the rutting period in July and August. They are active in the early morning and the late afternoon.\nDescription.\nRusa deer are known by their large ears, the tufts of hair above the eyebrows, and antlers. Males are bigger than females. Males weigh 152\u2013160\u00a0kg. Females weigh about 74\u00a0kg. Unlike most other types of deer, newborn fawns do not have spots.\nDistribution.\nThe Javan rusa natively lives on the islands of Java, Bali, and Timor in Indonesia. It has been introduced to Irian Jaya, Borneo (Kalimantan), the Lesser Sunda Islands, Maluku, Sulawesi, Pohnpei, Mauritius, Fiji, Tonga, Samoa, Vanuatu, the Solomon Islands, the Christmas Islands, the Cocos Islands, Nauru, Australia, New Caledonia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, New Britain, and New Ireland. Rusa deer were introduced to New Guinea in the early 1900s.\nIt prefers open dry and mixed deciduous forests, parklands, and savannas. Rusa deer have populations in remote islands, and may have been brought there by Indonesian fishermen.\nEcology.\nRusa deer are mostly active in the early morning and late afternoon. They are almost never seen in open places. They are very difficult to come close to because of their sharp senses and cautious instincts.\nThe Javan rusa are almost never found alone. When scared, a rusa male lets out an really loud honk. This is an alarm call and alerts any other deer in the area.\nJust like other types of deer, Javan rusa mostly eat grass, leaves, and fallen fruit. They do not drink water, because they get all their water from their food.\nThe main predators of the Javan rusa include the Javan leopard, the dhole, crocodiles, pythons, and the Komodo dragon.\nReproduction.\nThe Javan rusa breeds around July and August. When stags contest by calling in a loud, shrill bark and duelling with the antlers. The doe gives birth to one or two calves after a gestation of 8 months, at the beginning of spring. The young ones stop taking milk and start eating solid food at 6\u20138 months. They reach sexual maturity at 3\u20135 years, depending on the type of habitat. Javan rusas live 15\u201320 years both in the wild and in captivity."}

{"id": "300745", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=300745", "title": "Atlantic Wall", "text": "The Atlantic Wall (German: \"Atlantikwall\") was an extensive system of Coastal fortifications built by Nazi Germany between 1942 and 1944 along the western coast of Europe as a defense against an anticipated Allied invasion of the mainland continent from Great Britain.\nConstruction.\nOn March 23, 1942 F\u00fchrer Directive Number 40 called for the official creation of the Atlantic Wall. After the St. Nazaire Raid, on April 13, 1942 Adolf Hitler ordered naval and submarine bases to be heavily defended. Fortifications remained concentrated around ports until late in 1943 when defences were increased in other areas.\nOrganisation Todt, which had designed the Siegfried Line (\"Westwall\") along the Franco-German border, was the chief engineering group responsible for the design and construction of the wall's major fortifications. Thousands of forced laborers were impressed to construct these permanent fortifications along the Dutch, Belgian and French coasts facing the English Channel.\nEarly in 1944, Field Marshal Erwin Rommel was assigned to improve the Wall's defences. Rommel believed the existing coastal fortifications were entirely inadequate and he began strengthening them. He knew that the beaches between were barely defended, and the Allies could land there and capture the ports from the land. Under his direction, a string of reinforced concrete pillboxes were built along the beaches, or sometimes slightly inland, to house machine guns, anti-tank guns, and light artillery. Mines and antitank obstacles were planted on the beaches themselves, and underwater obstacles and mines were placed in waters just off shore. The intent was to destroy the Allied landing craft before they could unload.\nThe Germans laid almost six million mines in northern France. More gun emplacements and minefields extended inland, along roads leading away from the beaches. In likely landing spots for military gliders and paratroopers, the Germans installed slanted poles with sharpened tops, which the troops called \"Rommelspargel\" (\"Rommel's asparagus\"). Low-lying land near rivers was flooded, as well. \nRommel firmly believed that Germany would inevitably be defeated unless the invasion could be stopped at the beach.\nAlthough the defensive wall was never completed the Wall's existence was used to address concerns of the Soviet Union for why the Second Front was not opened until June 6, 1944 (less than a year before the end of the war). The Wall primarily consisted of batteries, bunkers, and minefields, which during 1942\u20131944, stretched from the French-Spanish border to Norway (Festung Norwegen). Many bunkers still exist, for example near Scheveningen, Den Haag, Katwijk and in Normandy. In Oostende, Belgium the public may visit a well-preserved part of the defences. That section consists of emplacements of the \"Saltzwedel neu battery\" and the \"St\u00fctzpunkt Bensberg\", consisting of several men\u2019s quarters and the necessary facilities. These constructions were used by a unit of German military engineers (\"Pionierstab\") who were in charge of bunker construction.\nThe Channel Islands were heavily fortified, particularly the island of Alderney which is closest to England (Jersey being the closest to France). Hitler had decreed that one twelfth of the steel and concrete used in the Atlantic Wall go to the Channel Islands, because they were British territory. Despite the mooting of Operation Constellation \"et al.\", the Allies bypassed the islands and did not try to liberate them when they invaded Normandy. The islands' German garrisons did not surrender until 9 May 1945 \u2013 one day after the German armed forces on the mainland. The German garrison on Alderney did not surrender until 16 May.\nWalcheren Island was considered to be the \"strongest concentration of defences the Nazis had ever constructed.\"\nAtlantic Wall Commands.\nThe Atlantic Wall was not a single organisation except in the administration of its building. Militarily it was divided into eight commands:\nAtlantic Wall Fortresses.\nMany major ports and positions were made part of the Atlantic wall and received heavy fortifications, Hitler ordered them all to fight to the end and some of them remained in German hands until the unconditional surrender of Axis Forces on May 8, 1945. Several of the port fortresses were resupplied by submarine after being surrounded by Allied forces. The defenders of these positions included Slavic soldiers and SS troops. \nReferences.\nGerman Publication (PhD) in military history"}

The A43 now bypasses to the south-east of the village, between the village and the race circuit.\nHistory.\nThe village is listed in the Domesday Book.\nIn the Middle Ages the village trade was primarily in timber from the surrounding Whittlewood forest, through the use of coppicing. Coppicing is a method of managing a forest. It allows trees to regrow after they have been cut down. \nParish church.\nThe first chapel in Silverstone was built by 1200 AD. In about 1780 the mediaeval building was replaced by a Georgian building. That building was enlarged in 1841 and 1852. The entire church was demolished (torn down) in the 1880's and replaced by the present Church of England parish church of Saint Michael. The building is a Gothic Revival designed by JP St Aubyn. It was finished in 1884.\nFacilities.\nThe village has a public house, the White Horse Inn.\nAbout south of the village is the Silverstone Circuit. It was a Royal Air Force bomber base during World War II. Now it is the home of the British Grand Prix, a Formula One race. The race track attracts more than 300,000 visitors each year."}

Murray has been with Iron Maiden since 1980.\nCareer.\nMurray is considered the second original member of Iron Maiden along with the founder Steve Harris. He has played on every album since its debut in 1980. However, Murray joined in 1976, just two months after they formed in 1975. He was forced to leave the band that year by the vocalist Dennis Wilcock, but returned months later. His solos are characterized for being fluid and clean, making rapid progress note after note through techniques that use the right hand using especially a lot of \"Hammer and tapping\", based on the legato technique. A characteristic in live performance is the vocalization which makes while playing fast parts, as if singing at the same time than playing his Fender Stratocaster.\nFirst years.\nDavid Michael Murray was born on 23 December 1956 in Edmunton, England. Dave's mother often worked part-time at a bar, because his father was at a young age retired consequence of a disease. The money for the maintenance of the house came irregularly. The frustration and poverty took their parents to a continuous fighting which caused her mother to take him together with her sisters to the nearest army refuge, where they used to spend weeks protected from the occasional attacks of fury of his father.\nDuring his adolescence, Dave was interested in music, so he developed an cardboard-electric guitar to mimic the Beatles records, also that he risked playing with the piano of a bar that was in the bottom of a residential complex in which they lived for some time. In 1970 his family finally rented a more comfortable house in the county of Clapton, and that's how the future partner of Steve Harris, like many other teens in that time shaved his head.\nThe moment that completely changed the life of Dave and took him to a career which seemed impossible in his time and those who followed the style of skinhead, occurred at the age of 15 when heard for the first time the song \"Voodoo Child\" (part 2) of Jimi Hendrix on the radio, then it started to listen to bands like Thin Lizzy, Deep Purple, Black Sabbath, , Queen, Free, Judas Priest and .\nDave's love for rock understood everything he was referring to the \"rock culture\" so he grew his hair too much, which caused him problems with his skinhead friends. He Adopted hippie clothes and began to read the newspaper \"Melody Maker\" which spoke of the rock of that time, which also began to frequent shows and come out with a new group of friends, being the closest, Adrian Smith.\nIn terms of sound, he used a super distortion humbucker made by Dimarzio, who was replaced for a compact hot rails humbucker of the firm Seymour Duncan, both in bridge position.\nAdditional information.\nTogether with Steve Harris, Dave was the only \"irremovable member\" of Iron Maiden since its founding. He has participated in all records and has been a key piece to define the sound of the group, although it has not participated much in the compositions of letters he composed the rhythm guitar to most of the compositions of Steve Harris.\nBetween their compositions are the songs \"Charlotte the Harlot\" from the first album, \"Still Life\" from the album \"Piece of Mind.\" \"Deja Vu\" from the album \"Somewhere in Time,\" \"Chains of Misery\" and \"Judas Be My Guide\" from the album \"Fear of the Dark,\" \"Brave New World\", \"The Nomad\" and \"The Thin Line between Love and Hate\" from the album \"Brave New World\", \"Rainmaker\" and \"Age of Innocence\" from the album \"Dance of Death\" and \"the Reincarnation of Benjamin Breege\" from the album \"A Matter of Life and Death\".\nPersonal life.\nIn his spare time Murray is an avid golfer as seen at Rock in Rio DVD.

Several nations with crude oil have organised themselves and founded a cartel called OPEC. Through this cartel, they can fix the price at which they will sell oil. Food power works in much the same way. Nations usually do what is best for their citizens, who usually want food. \nFood power is part of food politics. Embargoes can also be used to put pressure on a nation. In order for a nation to make use of food power effectively, the nation must effectively apply and display scarcity, supply concentration, demand dispersion, and action independence. The four main nations that export enough agriculture to be able to exert food power are the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. The U.S. does appear to use food power for punishment. Some African countries have used food power in internal conflicts on a smaller scale."}

It was aimed at the globular star cluster M13, about 25,000 light years from Earth. M13 was chosen because it was the right size, and was in the sky at the right time and place for the ceremony. \nDr. Frank Drake, then at Cornell University and creator of the famous Drake equation, wrote the message, with help from Carl Sagan, among others. The message was in seven parts which show:\nIt will take 25,000 years for the message to reach the stars, and at least another 25,000 years to get any reply. This means the Arecibo message was a show of human technological achievement, not a real attempt to talk to extraterrestrial life. The stars of M13 that the message was aimed at will no longer be in that location when the message arrives. Cornell University said on November 12, 1999, the real purpose of the message was not to make contact, but to show the power of the new equipment. (Cornell University had built and operated the radio telescope for the United States National Science Foundation.)\nThe message consisted of 1679 binary digits, about 210 bytes. It was transmitted at a frequency of 2380\u00a0MHz and modulated by shifting the frequency by 10\u00a0Hz, with a power of 1000\u00a0kW. The \"ones\" and \"zeros\" were transmitted by frequency shifting at the rate of 10 bits per second. The total broadcast was less than three minutes.\nThe cardinality of 1679 was chosen because it is a semiprime. It can be arranged as a rectangle of 73 rows by 23 columns. The other arrangement, 23 rows by 73 columns, does not produce a meaningful result. The message forms the image shown on the right, or its inverse, when translated into graphics characters and spaces.\nIn 2009 the band Boxcutter made an album called the \"Arecibo Message\", which has a lot of short songs."}

I hope to continue doing that,\"\nIn an interview with both Ken Lim and Ratonel, Lim said that he \"didn't think that [Sylvia] did well\" when asked about his opinions about the results.

R. R. Tolkien and appears in their novels \"The Hobbit\" and \"The Lord of the Rings\".\nIt is a region in the northwest of Middle-earth, one of the continents of the fictional world of Arda where elapses the most part of J. R. R. Tolkien's legendarium. It is, in turn, within the great region of Eriador, where previously existed the kingdom of Arnor. Is inhabited only by hobbits, a race similar to the men and characterized by their short stature. Founded in the middle of the Third Age, their known history is small and with little significants events because the peaceful nature of its inhabitants, with the exception of the events that took place during the War of the Ring.\nEven if is not mentioned as such in the novel The Hobbit, J. R. R. Tolkien already was then an idea of what was the Shire, was created \"officially\" during the composition of the first chapter of The Lord of the Rings and inspired principally in the neighborhood of Sarehole, Birmingham, where the author lived during his childhood.\nThe Shire in the languages of the Middle-Earth.\nHobbits sometimes call it S\u00fbza (which means \"Shire\") or S\u00fbzat (\"the Shire\"), terms that have their origin in the Rohirric, the language of Rohan with which they came in contact before colonizing the Shire. On the other hand, in the Elvish language Sindarin they call it \"i Drann\". It is also called \"Four frames\", the name refers to their territorial division.\nGeography.\nAccording to Tolkien, the Shire measured 40 leagues (193\u00a0km, 120 miles) from the Far Downs in the west to the Brandywine Bridge in the east, and 50 leagues (241\u00a0km, 150 miles) from the northern moors to the marshes in the south, This is confirmed in an essay by Tolkien on translating The Lord of the Rings, where he describes the Shire as having an area of 18,000 square miles (47,000\u00a0km\u00b2).\nThe original territory of the Shire was bounded on the east by the Baranduin River, on the north by uplands rising to the old centre of Arnor, on the west by the White Downs, and on the south by marshland south of the River Shirebourne. After the original settlement, hobbits also expanded to the east into Buckland between the Baranduin and the Old Forest, and (much later) to the west into the Westmarch between the White Downs and the Tower Hills.\nThe Shire was originally divided into four Farthings. The outlying lands of Buckland and the Westmarch were formally added after the War of the Ring when they were officially granted by King Elessar. Within the Farthings there are some smaller unofficial clan homelands: the Tooks nearly all live in or near Tuckborough in Tookland, for instance. A Hobbit surname often indicates where the family came from: Samwise Gamgee's last name derives from Gamwich, where the family originated. Buckland was named for the Oldbucks (later called the Brandybucks).\nThe Shire was densely populated, with many towns and few cities, but still had large areas of forests and wetlands. It is described as a \"small land\", but beautiful and fruitful, beloved by its inhabitants. Their location gives it a natural fertility and therefore the hobbits have an extensive farming system, being able to find many supplies such as cereals, fruits, wood and pipe-weed (one of the favorite pleasures of the hobbits). However, its economy is almost self-sufficient and hobbits typically consume all the products of their crops, or reserve them for gifts.\nOrography.\nThe Shire is a region of low elevations, and these are no higher than hills. The main ones are:\nWeather.\nThe climate in the Shire was primarily temperate maritime or ocean, depending on the area. In general, temperatures are slightly warmer in the south than in the north and seasonal changes of temperature are lightly more pronounced (hotter summers and colder winters) in the extreme east than the extreme west. The rainfalls are moderate throughout the whole year and especially in the Northframe, Can snow during the occasional visits of polar air from the north.\nClimate studying and modeling based on local topography and geography by climatologists at the University of Bristol, UK, have found that the Shire holds an annual average temperature of 44 \u00b0F (6.7 \u00b0C) and an annual yearly precipitation average of 24 inches (61 cm), similar to that of Lincolnshire or Leicestershire, England, or Dunedin, New Zealand.\nPopulation.\nThe Shire is populated only by hobbits.

It was written by Ricky Vela. Vela had fallen in love with Selena's sister, Suzette Quintanilla. He then found out she was married. Vela was angry at this and wrote down his feelings. Selena's brother and producer of her music, A.B. Quintanilla III, liked the idea of turning his words into a song. The song was then co-produced by Bebu Silvetti. It was for Selena's fourth album \"Amor Prohibido\" (1994). The song's lyrics are a reference to Vela's unreturned love.\n\"No Me Queda M\u00e1s\" is a Spanish language ballad. It was released as a single in the United States and Mexico. The song reached number one on the US \"Billboard\" Hot Latin Tracks for seven weeks. The song became Selena's third number one single from her \"Amor Prohibido\" album. In 1995, it became the number-one song on the \"Billboard\" Top Latin Songs Year-End Chart. It also became the best-selling Latin single for 1995 in the United States.\nThe song had positive feedback from music critics. \"No Me Queda M\u00e1s\" was nominated for \"Song of the Year\" at the Broadcast Music Latin Awards. However, the music video of the song won the 1995 \"Billboard\" Latin Music Awards. The music video was shot at the Houston, Texas Amtrak station and other locations in San Antonio, Texas. Since the song was released, it has been covered by several artists. It remains one of Selena's most popular songs.\nBackground and inspiration.\n\"No Me Queda M\u00e1s\" was written by Ricky Vela. Vela was a keyboardist for Selena y Los Dinos. He had fallen in love with the drummer of the group, Suzette Quintanilla. Suzette is Selena and A.B. Quintanilla III's sister. After finding out she was married, Vela wrote about his feelings on paper. He was going to send it to Suzette. However, Selena needed more songs on what was going to be her next album. Selena's brother and music producer, A.B., decided to ask Vela if he had written anything. Vela had written songs before and some of his works were recorded by Selena. Vela told A.B. about his feelings for her sister Suzette. He showed him the paper where he wrote about how hurt he was. A.B., liked the idea of turning it into a song. They then worked together and turned it into a ballad.\nSelena recorded the song at her father and manager's record studio Q-Productions. It was produced by A.B. The song was then co-produced by Bebu Silvetti. It was for Selena's fourth album, \"Amor Prohibido\" (1994).\nComposition.\n\"No Me Queda M\u00e1s\" is a down-tempo ballad. It also has flamenco and ranchera music in the song. It is written in key of B minor. The song has 95 beats per minute. Selena's vocal range in the song spans two octaves. \"No Me Queda M\u00e1s\" uses traditional musical instruments such as the violin, trumpet and the Spanish guitar. Jose Behar, president of EMI Latin, asked Silvetti to mix the song. Behar believed if the song was \"sweeten\" it can help it's chart performance. The mixed version was then added to the re-release of \"Amor Prohibido\". It was shown on the cover of the album as a \"new version\". The song's lyrics explains the pain and sorrow of a woman who was betrayed by her boyfriend. In the song, the boyfriend left her to marry another female he liked. In the end, the woman hopes for the best for them and wishes them happiness while she cries.\nThe song tells the story of unreturned love. Carlos Mel\u00e9ndez, writer for \"El Nuevo Dia\", gave a positive feedback of the song because it had an orchestra feel to it. Mel\u00e9ndez also enjoyed the use of the string instrument. Ilan Stavans and Harold Augenbraum named the song a \"mariachi bolero\" in their book. Mario Tarradell of \"The Dallas Morning News\", agreed to this statement and said that it was a \"mournful mariachi-style ballad\".\nRelease and reception.\nJorge Velasquez called \"No Me Queda M\u00e1s\" a \"bonafide hit\" in his book.

Suzette was put on the drums. A.B. was put on the bass guitar. The family first showcased their band at their restaurant \"Papa Gayos\" (English: \"Parrots\"). Then they continued to sing at more and more different places.\nWithin a year the family's restaurant went bankrupt and the family was forced to move in with relatives as Abraham had quit his job to manage the restaurant full-time. The band then performed wherever they could, including weddings, street corners, fairs, and quincea\u00f1eras, at some places gaining a lot of appreciation, while others not so much. The band was even \"booed\" off while performing at a wedding, followed by food being thrown on stage.\nChris P\u00e9rez.\nIn 1988, the Quintanilla family was present at a party of the band Chris P\u00e9rez was currently in. Impressed by his talent, A.B. asked Chris to join \"Selena y Los Dinos\". Although he accepted, his support to the band proved to be much more than anticipated. Selena and Chris quickly fell in love and married in 1992. After Selena's death, Chris formed a band called the Chris P\u00e9rez Band which he dedicated a song to the Selena called \"The Best I Can\".

Gravity holds clusters together and gives them their spherical shape. Towards the centre of a clusters there are many stars in a relatively small space. \nGlobular clusters occur in the halo of a galaxy and in its disk. Those in the halo contain many more stars and are much older than the less dense open clusters in the disk. Globular clusters are fairly common: there are about 150 to 158 known globular clusters in the Milky Way. Large galaxies can have more: Andromeda may have as many as 500. \nSome giant elliptical galaxies, particularly those at the centres of galaxy clusters, such as M87, have as many as 13,000 globular clusters. These globular clusters orbit the galaxy out to huge distances, 40 kiloparsecs (approximately 131,000 light-years) or more.\nEvery galaxy of sufficient mass in the Local Group has its group of globular clusters, and almost every large galaxy surveyed has a system of globular clusters. The Sagittarius Dwarf and Canis Major Dwarf galaxies appear to be in the process of donating their associated globular clusters (such as Palomar 12) to the Milky Way. This demonstrates how many of this galaxy's globular clusters might have been acquired in the past.\nObservation history.\nThe first globular cluster discovered was M22 in 1665, but individual stars in a globular cluster were not seen until Charles Messier observed M4. The first eight globular clusters discovered are shown in the table. The \"M\" before a number refers to the catalogue of Charles Messier, while \"NGC\" is from the New General Catalogue.\nWilliam Herschel began a survey program in 1782 using larger telescopes and was able to resolve the stars in all 33 of the known globular clusters. In addition he found 37 additional clusters. In Herschel's 1789 catalog of deep sky objects, his second such, he became the first to use the name \"globular cluster\" as their description.\nThe number of globular clusters discovered continued to increase, reaching 83 in 1915, 93 in 1930 and 97 by 1947. A total of 152 globular clusters have now been discovered in the Milky Way galaxy, out of an estimated total of 180 \u00b1 20. These additional, undiscovered globular clusters are believed to be hidden behind the gas and dust of the Milky Way."}

The first Boomerang began operation in 1984 at Rafaela Padilla in Puebla, M\u00e9xico (which has since been moved to Six Flags M\u00e9xico), and it has become one of the most repeated roller coaster designs in the world, with 41 Boomerangs operating as of 2011, another two \"Standing but not operating\" or in storage, and one currently under construction.\nInformation.\nThe Boomerang operates with one train with 7 cars, each capable of carrying 4 people (28 people per train). The ride starts with the train being pulled backwards out of the station, up a lift hill by a catch-car. When the catch-car reaches the end of the lift hill, it releases the train, which rolls down through the station, then into a cobra roll. After the cobra roll, it goes through a loop after which it clicks onto a chain on the second lift hill. When the train reaches the end of the second lift hill, the chain is moved down, which causes the train to roll down (as it is not attached to the chain anymore) and do the same track backwards.\nProblems.\nBoomerang coasters have sometimes stalled, often in the cobra Roll element. As a precaution, many Boomerang coasters, are built with an access platform just under the cobra roll. Also, sometimes the train gets stuck on the second lift hill."}

They are Afrikaans, English, Ndebele, Northern Sotho, Sesotho, Swazi, Setswana, Tsonga, Venda, Xhosa and Zulu. Most South Africans (over 99%) speak one of these languages as a first language. Most South Africans can speak more than one language. Prior to 1994, South Africa had only two official languages, English and Afrikaans.\nAll the official languages are equally spoken and recognized everywhere in South Africa even though they are dominant in their respective provinces. Sesotho(Southern Sotho) is dominant in the Free State Province, Setswana(Gauteng and North West Province), Sepedi(Northern Sotho), Tshivenda and Xitsonga in Limpopo Province, isiZulu in Kwazulu Natal province, isiXhosa in Eastern/Western Cape Province. English and Afrikaans is common in all the provinces as English is a medium of instruction. Due to people migrating to different provinces in pursuit for work, there is always a chance you'll find multiple languages spoken in certain regions however a dominant language with respect to that province will prevail. \nThe English version of the South African constitution calls each of these languages by its name in that language. Sotho is called Sesotho, Tswana is called Setswana, Pedi is called Sepedi, Zulu is called \"isiZulu\", Xhosa language is called \"isiXhosa\", and so on. The languages listed in the constitution are: Sesotho(Southern Sotho), Setswana(Tswana), Sepedi(Northern Sotho), isiZulu (Zulu), isiXhosa (Xhosa), Afrikaans (Afrikaans), English (English), Xitsonga (Tsonga), Siswati (Swati), Tshivenda (Venda), and isiNdebele (Southern Ndebele).\nIn South Africa, Southern Ndebele is known simply as \"Ndebele\", since most speakers of Northern Ndebele live in Zimbabwe. The 1993 version of the Constitution referred to Northern Sotho as \"Sesotho sa Leboa\", but the 1996 version called it \"Sepedi\". Different government departments and official organizations use different names for Northern Sotho.\nThe main language of government is English. Afrikaans and English are both important languages used in commerce. Most rich South Africans speak Afrikaans and English. \nTwo of the official languages are West Germanic languages (English and Afrikaans). The other nine languages are Bantu languages. Four of the Bantu languages are part of the Nguni family (Zulu, Xhosa, Swati, Ndebele). Three of the Bantu languages are Sotho-Tswana languages (Northern Sotho, Southern Sotho, Setswana). Tsonga is a Tswa-Ronga language. South Africa also has a national sign languae, South African Sign Language."}

It was released on July 18, 1995 by EMI Records and EMI Latin. It was re-released on September 24, 2002 as part of the \"Selena: 20 Years of Music\" collection, which included bonus tracks, music videos and spoken liner notes by her family, friends, and her former band. \"Dreaming of You\" contains unreleased English and Spanish-language songs while also containing previously released songs that were remixed with dance hall and reggae. The first half of \"Dreaming of You\" contains mid-tempo R&amp;B ballads and pop songs, while the rest of \"Dreaming of You\" contains Latin music.\nBy 1993, EMI Latin believed Selena was ready to release a crossover album. They believed she was ready because she had won a Grammy Award and other awards, signed a sponsorship tour with Coca-Cola, dominated the Latin music charts, and expanded the Tejano Music Movement across the United States (the Tejano Music Movement, which was a movement in Texas at the time, helped other people enjoy Tejano music and it becoming a popular trend). They also believed Selena had reached her peak in the Spanish-language market and they wanted to launch her into a career as an American solo pop artist. She was partnered with major pop music producers, some of whom were Grammy Award winners. The record company wanted to change Selena's musical styles from Tejano to contemporary R&amp;B music. While Selena was recording songs, a crossover tour was being planned. On March 31, 1995, before \"Dreaming of You\" was scheduled to be released, Selena was killed by Yolanda Saldivar, who was a friend and manager of her clothing stores.\n\"Dreaming of You\" debuted at number one on the US \"Billboard\" 200 chart, and sold more than 331,000 copies in its first week. Selena became the first Hispanic singer to have an album, mostly in Spanish, to debut at number one. It went on to become the second-highest-selling debut album, behind Michael Jackson. On the date of release, \"Dreaming of You\" sold 175,000 copies, which helped Selena to become the second-fastest selling female artist, behind Janet Jackson. \"Dreaming of You\" had mixed to positive reviews from music critics, who many believed if Selena was alive to further promote the album, that it would have performed better on music charts globally. \"Dreaming of You\" won several awards including every award it was nominated at the 1996-98 Tejano Music Awards and the 1996-97 Premio Lo Nuestro awards.\nSeveral tracks from the album were released as singles in the United States and other countries. The title track, became instantly popular on radios throughout the United States. It peaked at number 22 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart and was able to reach the top 20 in many other charts. \"I Could Fall in Love\" also had the same success of the title track and peaked at number two on the Hot Latin Tracks and number eight on the Hot 100 Airplay chart. \"I'm Getting Used to You\" peaked at number eight on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles. The single \"T\u00fa S\u00f3lo T\u00fa\" peaked at number one on both the Hot Latin Tracks and Latin Regional Mexican Airplay charts. Songs such as \"Captive Heart\", \"Techno Cumbia\", \"Como La Flor\" and \"Missing My Baby\", which were not released as a single, managed to peaked on \"Billboard\" charts including; Hot Latin Tracks, Latin Regional Mexican Airplay, Canadian Hot 100 and the PROMUSICAE (Spain music charts).\nPre-Production.\nSelena performed at the 1989 Tejano Music Awards, which was attended by Jose Behar. Behar, the former president of Sony Music Latin, had recently opened EMI Latin. EMI Latin became the Latin division of EMI Records. The new president of Sony Music Latin was also attending the event and had wanted Selena to sign with his company. Selena's father and manager Abraham Quintanilla Jr was given offers from both Sony and EMI, however, Sony doubled the amount EMI was offering. Quintanilla Jr decided to go with EMI because they were offering the crossover deal Selena wanted, while Quintanilla Jr wanted his children to be the first band to sign with EMI Latin.\nBefore Selena signed her contract with EMI Latin in 1989, Behar and Stephen Finfer sent out a request to EMI Records for Selena to begin her crossover album. She recorded \"Only Love\", \"Is It the Beat?\", and \"Where Did the Feeling Go?\" for the presidents of EMI Records' pop division. Behar's and Finfer's request was denied. The presidents' told them that Selena needed a bigger fan base in order to sell a lot of copies of a crossover album. Behar told in an interview that he thought EMI Records, and people in general, did not believe that a Mexican American woman could be \"successful\". By 1993 Selena had won a Grammy Award for \"Selena Live!\" (1993), won several other awards, signed a sponsorship tour with Coca-Cola, dominated the Latin music charts, and expanded the Tejano Music Movement across the United States.\nEMI Latin believed Selena should release a crossover album, believing she had reached her peak in the Spanish-language market. They wanted to launch her career as an American solo pop artist. Selena was signed with EMI's SBK Records in November 1993 after less than twenty-four hours in Los Angeles. News of Selena being signed with SBK made front-page news on \"Billboard\" magazine. Selena said that she was frighten by the recording deal because the situation was new to her and that only a few people had believed she would achieve success in the pop world. Selena said in interviews that the album would be released in 1994. However, following the release of \"Amor Prohibido\" in March 1994, she said the album was still being developed. During a dinner in a Thai restaurant in 1994, Selena was upset about the pressure she was under from the press about the album. She said, to Behar, that she told a lot of news crews that the album was about to be released and that she has yet to record a single song. Behar believed Selena was joking because she had always like telling jokes, but then noticed she was not setting up a joke and believed she was right. Behar then told the chairman of EMI Records, Charles Koppelman, that Selena and her band Los Dinos would leave EMI and find a record company willing to record an English-language album for Selena. Behar had lied to the chairman about Selena leaving in order to force the crossover album to begin. Koppelman did not want Selena to leave and began the recording sessions.\nProduction and development.\nSelena started recording the first song for the album, \"I Could Fall in Love\", in late 1994. Selena was partnered with major pop music producers, some of which were Grammy Award winners. Selena's sister Suzette Quintanilla stated that Selena would take a very long time before deciding on a song that was \"Selena\". However, SBK Records controlled the entire project and only allowed Selena to choose one song. This was because, SBK knew what they were doing for a crossover event. Recording sessions for the album took place at several recording studios, including: her father's Q-Productions studio in Corpus Christi; The Bennett House in Franklin, Tennessee; Bananaboat Studio in Burbank, California; Oakshire Recorders in Los Angeles; Conway Studios in Hollywood; Clinton Studios in Clinton, New York; and Levosia Entertainment in Hollywood. Producers and songwriters who worked with Selena on the album included Keith Thomas, Trey Lorenz of Epic Records, Mark Goldenberg, Kit Hain, Guy Roche, Donna Delorey, Diane Warren, Rhett Lawrence, David Byrne of Luaka Bop Inc., Franne Golde, Tom Snow, Full Force, Brian \"Red\" Moore, A.B. Quintanilla III Selena's brother, Barrio Boyzz, K.C. Porter, Felipe Bernmejo, Jose Hernandez and Felipe Valdes Leal. Singers, Amy Grant and Vanessa Williams were both in the process of writing a song for Selena. \"Dreaming of You\" was the first album that Selena's family did not produce. Her family had wanted professional pop producers to work with Selena. Selena found this decision stressful, and felt that it was forced on her in order to sell records.\nSelena co-wrote with David Byrne, former lead singer of Talking Heads, for his gospel song \"God's Child (Baila Conmigo)\". Her vocals were later used in the song after Byrne recorded it in Clifton, New York. Selena's brother Quintanilla III and her husband Chris Perez did not like \"Dreaming of You\". They both later stated that they grew to love it after Selena was murdered. While being interviewed, Keith Thomas stated that every time Selena would walk in the recording studio that all eyes would be on her because of her smiles, energy, and eager to succeed, who made everyone laugh. Thomas also stated that there were no ego problems with her. Selena had recorded songs in late 1994 and had recorded a total of six songs by January 20, 1995. Selena was supposed to record \"Oh No (I'll Never Fall in Love Again)\" on the morning of March 31, 1995. However, she was killed on the same day by Yolanda Saldivar, a friend and ex-manager of her clothing stores. \"Oh No\" was later recorded in Spanish by her brother's band, Kumbia Kings, on their album \"Amor, Familia y Respecto\" (2009). Thomas, who wrote \"I Could Fall in Love\", never finished his second song that Selena was supposed to record and talked about the song while being interviewed for the A&amp;E series \"Biography\" in 2008. In 2008, freestyle singer Brenda K. Starr, revealed that she was supposed to be in two unrecorded duets with Selena. In June 2011, Dominican American Latin soul singer TeCheetah Lopez was given a demo of \"Love Me Now\", which was supposed to be for Selena to record. \"Love Me Now\" was written by Christopher Troy and Zac Harmon. According to Behar, \"Dreaming of You\" was supposed to be released in September or October 1995. In April 1995, EMI Latin decided to only release four out of the six English-language songs Selena had recorded. The song \"Siempre Hace Frio\" was taken off of \"Dreaming of You\".\nRecording and composition.\n\"I Could Fall in Love\", the first promotional single, was written by Keith Thomas and is a soft rock, pop, R&amp;B and soul. \"I Could Fall in Love\" is written in the key of E major and moves at a moderate 86 beats per minute. Selena's vocal range in the song spans four octaves with music notes F#3-A4. Its lyrics are about a woman who is in love with a guy who does not know about her true feelings for him. She tries to tell him, but is afraid of rejection, she decides not tell him. According to \"The Billboard Book of Number One Albums\", \"I Could Fall in Love\" was chosen as the \"best song\" off of \"Dreaming of You\" and \"... could melt the hearts of millions around the world\". Kathleen Tracy wrote that \"I Could Fall in Love\" and \"Dreaming of You\" are two hit \"ballads\". James Hunter of \"Vibe\" stated that he liked Selena's passion that she used to record \"I Could Fall in Love\". Hunter also stated that the song is a \"masterpiece\", while also stating that because of Selena's death, it was hard to listen to the song without crying. After Selena's death, \"I Could Fall in Love\" became a popular wedding song.\n\"Dreaming of You\", the lead single, was written by Franne Golde and Tom Snow. \"Dreaming of You\" is a power ballad and contemporary R&amp;B. The song's main instruments are the piano, wind chimes and funk bass. \"Dreaming of You\" is written in Ab major and begins in the key of G\u266f(Ab). It changes to the key of A\u266f(Bb) after the bridge. Selena's vocal range spans Eb3-Eb5. \"The Los Angeles Times\" ranked \"Dreaming of You\" number five from their \"Top-ten Singles of 1995\". Its lyrics are about a lonely and depressed woman in her room at night, who dreams of being with her boyfriend. The song begins with a low-key instrumentation, which provides emphasis for Selena's vocals. Geraldo Martinez of \"El Dictamen\" wrote that the opening of the song was \"surprisingly tantalizing\". \"Dreaming of You\" became Selena's signature song and was given positive feedback from music critics.\n\"I'm Getting Used to You\", the second promotional single, was written by Diane Warren and was produced by Rhett Lawrence. Four dance mixes were remixed by David Morales, which were created for promotional use. \"I'm Getting Used to You\" is a baroque- and dream-pop song and is written in the key of F major. Because of the music's easy piano notes it was included in the \"Top Pop Hits of 1996 for Easy Piano\" book. Its lyrics are about a woman who does not know what love is and her boyfriend tries to help her understand by \"opening her eyes\" to true love.\n\"Captive Heart\", is a synthpop, electro and fast rock song. \"Captive Heart\" is an uptemo song written by Kit Hain. It was released as the album's first promotional single in the United Kingdom. Its lyrics are about a woman being controlled by her partner who will not let her be free of her own emotions. She is unable to end the relationship because she is too in love with him. Ed Morales of \"Vibe\" compared both Evelyn \"Champagne\" King and \"Wherever You Are\" (the English version of \"Donde Quiera Que Estes\") with \"Captive Heart\". According to the \"Chicago Tribune\" \"Captive Heart\" was the right song for urban-contemporary radios. The \"Daily Vault\" believed Selena made a mistake with \"Captive Heart\" because she had used too much \"throat\" in the song.\n\"God's Child (Baila Conmigo)\", a duet with David Byrne, was originally recorded for the \"Don Juan DeMarco\" soundtrack. After Selena was murdered, EMI Latin decided to use the song for \"Dreaming of You\". Byrne recorded his parts in New York, while Selena recorded her verse in Corpus Christi, Texas, at her father's recording studio. \"God's Child\" was later used for the \"Blue in The Face\" soundtrack. According to the \"Chicago Tribune\", \"God's Child (Baila Conmigo)\", is an \"energetic, dark and mysterious\" song. They also stated that the song is a rumba flamenco with rock and R&amp;B. Christopher John Farley of \"Time\" stated that the song is a \"\u00a0...\u00a0giddy soulful song\".\n\"El Toro Relajo\" was an unreleased Spanish-language mariachi-ballad. It was written by Felipe Bermejo and produced by Jose Hernandez. It became the sixth single to be released from \"Dreaming of You\". Its lyrics are about a woman warning a man, during a bullfighting competition, that the bull is not tame. She then tries to tame the bull before her lover rides it. The band Mariachi Sol de Mexico were the backup singers for the song. \"El Toro Relajo\" was also recorded for the \"Don Juan DeMarco\" soundtrack. The \"Daily Vault\" believed the song was the \"most impressive track\" on \"Dreaming of You\". The \"Daily Vault\" also stated that it was \"short, amusing, and dedicated\". After Selena's death, the song became a traditional Cinco de Mayo celebration song. Brennan told \"Time\" magazine that he believes the company who dropped \"El Toro Relajo\" from the \"Don Juan DeMarco\" soundtrack, regrets ever doing so. \"T\u00fa S\u00f3lo T\u00fa\" became the seventh single released from \"Dreaming of You\". John Lannert of \"Billboard\" called it a \"classic emotive (emotional) ballad\". Christopher John Farley of \"Time\" said that \"T\u00fa S\u00f3lo T\u00fa\" is a \"spirited mariachi song\".\nRelease.\n\"Dreaming of You\" was scheduled to be released sometime in 1994. However, following \"Amor Prohibido\", Selena's last Spanish studio album, the album was delayed. Selena told in an interview on January 20, 1995 that the album would be released in July. EMI Records and EMI Latin released \"Dreaming of You\" on July 18, 1995. It debuted at number one on the US \"Billboard\" 200 chart. \"Dreaming of You\" replaced the \"Pocahontas\" soundtrack spot as the number one album on the \"Billboard\" 200. \"Dreaming of You\" was among the ten best-selling debuts ever, and was the best-selling debut by a female artist. Selena fans in Dallas, Texas, began lining up to buy the album hours before stores were open. \"Dreaming of You\" sold 331,000 copies in its first week. It became the biggest first-week seller by a female artist. It also became the first album by a Hispanic artist to debut at number one. EMI believed that \"Dreaming of You\" sold more than 400,000 copies because SoundScan did not track copies sold in small stores.\n\"Dreaming of You\" also debuted at number one on the \"Billboard\" Top Latin Albums and \"Billboard\" Latin Pop Albums charts. It remained on the charts for nearly two-hundred weeks. In Austin, stores were sold out of \"Dreaming of You\" within minutes on the day it was released. Throughout the entire city, Austin stores only allowed two copies per costumer. Fans in Corpus Christi began celebrating the release of \"Dreaming of You\" the day before the album was released, at music stores across the city. \"Dreaming of You\" was sold in approximately fifteen countries, and in the months following its release, Selena became more famous. \"I Could Fall in Love\" and \"Dreaming of You\" were played on English speaking radio stations, mostly on Adult contemporary radios. In Texas alone, \"Dreaming of You\" sold half a million copies.\nWithin ten months of release, \"Dreaming of You\" was nearing triple-platinum status. It was certified 3.5 time platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), for shipping more than 3,500,000 copies in its first year. \"Billboard\" named \"I Could Fall in Love\" and \"Dreaming of You\" the number one and two spots, in the \"Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits\". \"Dreaming of You\" sold over 2,000,000 copies its first year. EMI Latin was backed up with orders of 500,000 copies from retail stores. \"Dreaming of You\" was considered the \"highest selling Latin album\" since Julio Iglesias recorded his first English-language record \"110 Bel Air Place\" (1984). \"Dreaming of You\" was certified Gold in Canada, for shipments of 50,000 copies.\nIn the same month of its release, \"Dreaming of You\" joined five of Selena's studio albums that were in the top ten on the \"Billboard\" Top 50 Latin Albums. The album peaked at number one, two years later \"Dreaming of You\" and \"Siempre Selena\" (1996) continued to chart on the \"Billboard\" Latin 50. \"Dreaming of You\" became the first album by a Hispanic singer to debut at number one. Some Texas stores believed that the sale figures for \"Dreaming of You\" in their state were wrong because the album had sold poorly at their music stores.\nPromotion.\nCrossover Tour.\nThe Crossover Tour was a scheduled world tour. It was supposed to help promote \"Dreaming of You\" worldwide. The tour was scheduled to begin in mid-1995, after the album was released. The Crossover Tour was also going to promote Selena in countries where she was not well known in.\nCommercial promotion.\nThere were several commercials released in the US, Mexico and South America. Behar said that promotion \"... will be on the superstar scale\" and that \"[We] didn't put this marketing campaign behind it because there was a tragedy. ... We put this marketing campaign behind it because we believed that this was going to be a huge album because of the music. This is a record that we're going to work over the next 10 months.\"\nIn Texas and Mexico, bootleggers sold copies of \"Dreaming of You\". A bootlegger is a person who takes the music of an album and copy's it to a blank CD and make profit by selling the blank CDs to people on the streets. One, in Corpus Christi, tried selling a bootleg to Selena's father, without knowing who he was. Quintanilla Jr, took all the copies and reported the man to local police. There are no known reports of the public bootleggers, although Quintanilla Jr reported any he found to police. \"TVyNovelas\" believed that 50,000 copies of \"Dreaming of You\" bootlegs were sold, at five dollars each.\nCritical reception.\nStephen Erlewine of Allmusic wrote that most Americans first learned about Selena because of her murder, and \"Dreaming of You\" was the first record of Selena's that they heard. He wrote: \"\"Dreaming of You\" would have been a stronger album if she had lived, but it still stands as a powerful\u00a0\u2013 and touching\u00a0\u2013 testament to her talents.\" \"Billboard\" stated that Selena recorded songs that were \"pop\" and not \"Tejano\" music. \"Vibe\" editor Ed Morales called the album a \"cumbia\" and \"Tex-Mex\" (Tejano) album. James Hunter, also from \"Vibe\", believed it was hard to listen to the album because Selena's death was recent.\nThe \"Chicago Tribune\"s Achy Obejas wrote that \"Dreaming of You\" was an \"incomplete\" album that has a lot of mistakes in the selection of songs Selena recorded. Christopher John Farley of \"Time\" believed \"Dreaming of You\" helped Selena to become more popular in America. Enrique Lopetegui of the \"Los Angeles Times\" wrote that \"Dreaming of You\" was Selena's most \"satisfying\" album. Mary Talbot of the \"New York Daily News\" believed the album was able to reveal what Selena's career would have been like if she was alive.\nPersonnel and credits.\nCredits are taken from the album's liner notes."}

The album became the final album to be released from RP Records. Selena's brother, A.B. Quintanilla III had became the main songwriter. Selena recorded fourteen songs but only released ten. All the songs were recorded in three different recording studios. \"Dulce Amor\" helped Selena to be noticed at the 1989 Tejano Music Awards. She was then signed by EMI Latin. The album had only sold over 30,000 copies. It was ordered to be removed from stores by EMI Records.\nMost of the songs produced were Tejano music mixed with Cumbia and Jazz fusion. \"Dulce Amor\" was nominated for \"Album of the Year\" while the song of the same name was nominated for \"Song of the Year\". Selena had won \"Female Vocalist of the Year\" and \"Female Entertainer of the Year\". Selena had promoted the album during her Dulce Amor Tour which had only lasted for less than a year. The album had mixed to negative reviews from music critics. The album was re-released in 2007 as \"Classic Series Vol. 5\".\nProduction and development.\nAfter Selena's sixth LP record \"Preciosa\" (1988) sold only 25,000 copies, the company had wanted Selena to record another record. The success from \"Preciosa\" had the company believing that Selena would sell more copies with her next album. In July 1988, Selena was in the recording studio and began recording songs. Her brother, A.B. Quintanilla III had became the main songwriter for Selena. Juan Gabriel, a Mexican songwriter, had given Selena the rights to record \"Costumbres\". Ricky Vela, a Selena y Los Dinos member, had written the song \"Quisiera Darte\". The song \"Qu\u00e9\" was written by Manny Guerra, the record manager for RP Records and GP Productions. The songs \"T\u00fa Solamente T\u00fa\" and \"La Puerta Se Cerro\" were written by unknown writers. On the liner notes, the writing credits are given to \"Pendiente\" which means \"Pending\" in Spanish.\nIt had took Selena three weeks to record fourteen songs. However, the record company only had wanted ten songs to be on the album. The others remained unreleased. Selena had recorded the songs \"Dulce Amor\", \"T\u00fa Solamente T\u00fa\", \"La Puerta Se Cerro\", \"Costumbres\", and \"Dime\" at RP Records studios in San Antonio, Texas. The songs \"Always Mine\", \"No Llores M\u00e1s Coraz\u00f3n\" and \"Cari\u00f1o, Cari\u00f1o Mio\" were recorded in Houston, Texas. \"Quisiera Darte\" and the unreleased tracks were recorded in Hollywood, California. The song \"T\u00fa Solamente T\u00fa\" was originally recorded by Selena for her debut album \"Selena y Los Dinos\" (1984).\nWhile Selena was performing at the 1989 Tejano Music Awards, Jose Behar (who was the former head of Sony Music Latin) was among the audience that night. He instantly wanted Selena to sign with EMI. Behar called his boss stating that he believe he had found the next Gloria Estefan. His boss told him that he was crazy, because Behar only had been in South Texas for only a week. Selena was later signed with EMI Latin the following year. \"Dulce Amor\" became her last independent LP record.\nRelease.\n\"Dulce Amor\" was released on December 24, 1988. The album was supposed to be released in the summer of 1989. However, Manny Guerra had wanted the album to be released real quick. Guerra believed that if the album would have been released in the summer, that not too many Tejano fans would buy the album. He said, because popular music albums are released in that period. When the album was released, it had sold only 2,000 copies the first day. \"Preciosa\" (1988) had sold 3,600 copies on its first day. Guerra was not happy about the sales of the album. However, within a month the album sold 10,000 copies. It outperformed all of Selena's previous records. By August 1989, the album sold 33,206 copies. It was then pulled off shelves because of Selena's upcoming debut album with EMI Latin. EMI Latin bought all the original copies of the album. Only 50,000 copies of the album were shipped in Texas alone.\nIn 1995, Selena's father Abraham Quintanilla Jr had bought the rights to Selena's albums (1984-1989 period) from EMI Latin. Since then, he has released the songs in compilation albums. The songs \"Always Mine\", \"No Llores Mas Corazon\" and \"La Puerta Se Cerro\" were selected to be remixed for \"Anthology\" (1998).\nOn September 7, 2007, Quintanilla Jr re-released the album as part of the \"Classic Series\" collection. \"Dulce Amor\" was then re-titled \"Classic Series Vol. 5\". All the songs were remastered.\nComposition.\n\"Dulce Amor\" (\"Sweet Love\") was the lead single from \"Dulce Amor\". The song was written by A.B. Quintanilla III. It was produced by Timothy Muniz. \"Dulce Amor\" was nominated for \"Song of the Year\" at the 1989 Tejano Music Awards. The song had its key signature in common time. It was performed on G minor with 106 beats per minute. The songs lyrics are about a girl expressing her emotions about a guy she really love. The song was mixed with Cumbia music and Jazz fusion.\n\"Qu\u00e9\" (\"What\") was the second single released from \"Dulce Amor\". The song's writer is unknown. It was produced by Manny Guerra. The song was performed on G minor with 147 beats per minute. The songs lyrics are about a girl who has been tricked into believing that a guy really loved her. She feels a sense of loneliness and doubts herself. The songs' message is that, you can't always trust someone until you get to know them for who they really are. The song was mixed with Ranchera music and Mariachi.\n\"Always Mine\" was the third single released from \"Dulce Amor\". The song was written by A.B. Quintanilla III. It was produced by Roger Garcia, who was the former back-up guitarist for Selena y Los Dinos. \"Always Mine\" was selected to be remixed for \"Anthology\" (1998). The remixed version peaked at number four on the Hot Dance Club Songs chart and number 94 on the Canadian Hot 100. The song describes a teen romance. A young girl who is under peer pressure by her friends must decide who she wants to be with. She struggles with low self-esteem. The song had its key signature in common time. It was performed on B minor with 100 beats per minute. The song was mixed with Polka, Pop and Contemporary R&amp;B.\n\"Cari\u00f1o, Cari\u00f1o Mio\" (\"Sweetheart, Sweetheart of Mine\") was the fourth single released from \"Dulce Amor\". The song was written by A.B. Quintanilla III. It was produced by Lauren and Carlos Diaz. The songs lyrics are about a girl who is in love with a guy. She sings about giving anything to him, just to be with him. The song had its key signature in common time. It was performed on D major with 103 beats per minute. The song was mixed with Polka and Jazz.\n\"Quisiera Darte\" (\"I Give\") was the fifth and last single released from \"Dulce Amor\". The song was written by Ricky Vela, who was the lead keyboardist for Selena y Los Dinos. The song was produced by Manny Guerra. The songs lyrics are about a girl asking her boyfriend if their relationship is \"love\". She tells him that she would do anything for him, and feels that their relationship is love. The song had its key signature in common time. It was performed on C minor with 93 beats per minute. The song was mixed with Jazz and Cumbia music.\nPromotion.\nSelena had promoted \"Dulce Amor\" during her Dulce Amor Tour. Selena also promoted \"Preciosa\" (1988) along with her Dulce Amor Tour. This was because the two albums were released in the same year. Selena had performed songs from \"Dulce Amor\" on the Johnny Canales Show in South Texas, she also had done live concerts across Texas. Selena earned $20,000 from the Dulce Amor Tour, which was double the amount she had made for her Preciosa Tour.\nCritical reception.\nNorberto Garcia of \"Texas Monthly\" stated that \"Dulce Amor\" was one of Selena's \"strongest\" LP record because it \"showcase her exotic voice and expanded her talents[...]\". Domingo Rivera of \"Tejano Nation\" believed every song on \"Dulce Amor\" was horrible. Rivera stated that he did not like not even one song. He also stated that Selena could have done better with modern styles of Tejano music instead of mixing 1960s music into her songs. Rivera then stated the album was \"out of date\" even when it was released in 1988. Sophia Vargas of \"Tejano Weekly\" believed that \"Dulce Amor\" was not Selena's best of work. Vargas believed that RP Records did not put their \"all\" for Selena.\nPersonnel.\nCredits are taken from the album's liner notes."}

It was created by Jonathan Murray for Oxygen TV channel. The show is about seven women who are called \"bad girls\" because of their bad behavior. They come from different races and backgrounds. They have psychological and behavior problems. They are put in a big house to live for three months. The production team video tapes their life inside and outside of the house. They live in the house to try and change their \"bad ways\" and become role models. They have to obey the rules they were given. If they don't follow them, they can be removed from the show. If this happens, a \"replacement\" will arrive at the house.\nIn season one and season two, the premise of the show was different from other seasons. There has been six complete seasons of \"The Bad Girls Club\". The ninth season is currently airing on Oxygen. The fourth season had the highest ratings. It became the \"breakthrough season\" for the show. The show is broadcast in five different countries. \"The Bad Girls Club\" was given negative feedback from television critics. This is because the show is about girls fighting. Teenagers have also pretended to be like the girls in the show. This made schools in the United States to dislike the show. Some schools even started banning the show in their cities.\nThere has been a lot of conflicts about the show. This is because some cast-members stated opinions that made the public very angry. There have been three spin-offs of \"The Bad Girls Club\". has been a rating success. The show is about three former \"bad girls\" looking for love. Oxygen released mobile games, comic strip and merchandise to help promote the show. There has been 62 people who been on the show. Kerry Harvick (from the first season) became a country singer. Tanisha Thomas (from the second season) became a host in many \"Bad Girls Club\" spin-offs. Amber Meade, Amber Buhl, Sarah Michaels, Kendra Jones, Natalie Nunn and Lea Beaulieu were in the \"Love Games: Bad Girls Need Love Too\" show.\nAbout the show.\nThe show follows seven women. They are between the ages of 21 and 27. They live in a big house for three months. The production team video tapes their lives in and out of the house. The girls are called \"bad girls\". This is because of their bad behavior. However, they are put in the show because they want to change their \"bad ways\". They also want to become role models to young women. Other \"bad girls\" are only there to reach goals of their own. In the show, the \"bad girls\" must try to live with each other. They must also try and deal with a lot of changes from their roommates. They must follow all the rules that they were given. If they break a \"bad girl\" breaks a rule, she will be removed from the show. A \"replacement\" is then brought in. A replacement is a \"bad girl\" who did not enter the house on the first night. She is brought in the show, to fill in. This is because the show is about seven women trying to change. The \"bad girls\" have to talk in a room about their day.\nSometimes, a \"bad girl\" may divide into cliques. Create bad behavior to feel happy, book parties in nightclubs and shop for food. They must also maintain their personal lives. The \"bad girls\" are allowed to contact their families and boyfriends (or girlfriends). They are given a home computer to communicate with the world. However, watching television and having a cell phone is not allowed. Bullying and double tagging is known to happen in the show. Double tagging means that two or more \"bad girls\" jump one of their roommates. Sometimes, a \"bad girl\" may wish to leave the show. This is because of their roommates who are bullying them, being or feeling alone, problems at home, court dates, or because they feel like they are \"better\" then the girls in the house.\nIt is rare if two or more replacements come into the show. The only seasons to have a lot of replacements was season one (2006), season five (2010) and season six (2011). The replacement \"bad girl\" is always treated badly by the original cast. It is rare if a replacement wants to leave the show. The only season to have a replacement leave was on the fifth season.\nThis is the \"Bad Girls Club\" creed. It was first seen in the third season.\nSeason one and Season two.\nThe show was different in these two seasons. The age requirements were 21 and 31. \"Nicknames\" were not given to anyone. Nicknames started in the third season. Season one was the first season to have a lot of replacement \"bad girls\". Even though this season was different, the rules were kept the same for later seasons. Another thing that stood the same was how the first episode started. The first episode always starts with a physical fight. The fight that is seen, shows how the first \"bad girl\" is removed from the show.\nFor the second season, the show began to change. The maximum age requirements to apply dropped from 35 to 27. The cast had to work. They were given jobs that did not give them any money. They had to learn how to be dependent on others for teamwork. They also needed to build a work ethic. This skill would help them in their life after the show. If a \"bad girl\" wanted to quit her job or did not show up, she would be removed from the show. The girls were given the jobs of planning and decision making. This became the first and only season to have the \"bad girls\" working. This was also the last time episodes were only 30-minutes long.\nLive shows.\nThe OxygenLive was released on August 3, 2010. This allowed fans of the show to submit their opinions about the season or the cast. Fans had to submit their comments on Facebook or Twitter. Their comments were then showed during the re-cap episode of \"The Bad Girls Club\". OxygenLive! was an online talk show. Tanisha Thomas (from season two) was the hose. The live show debuted after the first episode of the sixth season aired on Oxygen. The show was about talking with the cast of season six. Thomas gave them questions to answer from fans.\nU.S. television ratings.\n\"Viewers\" is the estimated number viewers that watched a program either while it was broadcast or watched via DVR on the same day the program was broadcast.\nCast members.\n Contestant's age at the start of the season.\n U.S. state abbreviations can be found here."}

They occur in reed beds. They are all members of the order Poales.\nReeds are many polyphyletic species, which have all adapted to this wet habitat by convergent evolution.\n\"Phragmites australis\", the common reed, is used in many areas for thatching rooves (roofs). When thatched rooves were common, rivers were harvested for reeds every year. The reeds were stored in barns, and purchased by roofers for thatching. In the United Kingdom, common reed used for this purpose is known as \"Norfolk reed\" or \"water reed\". However, \"wheat reed\" and \"Devon reed\" are not reeds but long-stemmed wheat straw.\nIn Britain, thatching began to be less used in the early 19th century. It was replaced by slates from quarries in Wales. Later still, slate tiles were replaced by the cheaper mass-manufactured plastic tiles.\nTypes of reeds.\nReeds come from many different plants, all of which grow in or near to water.

Examples might be: flowering time, drought tolerance, polymorphism, mimicry, defence against predators. \nResearch usually involve a mixture of field and laboratory studies. Samples of natural populations may be taken back to the laboratory for their genetic variation to be analysed. Changes in the populations at different times and places will be noted, and the pattern of mortality in these populations will be studied. Research is often done on insects and other organisms that have short generation times.\nHistory.\nAlthough work on natural populations had been done previously, it is acknowledged that the field was founded by the English biologist E.B. Ford (1901\u20131988) in the early 20th century. Ford was taught genetics at Oxford University by Julian Huxley, and started research on the genetics of natural populations in 1924. Ford also had a long working relationship with R.A. Fisher. By the time Ford had developed his formal definition of genetic polymorphism, Fisher had got accustomed to high natural selection values in nature. This was one of the main outcomes of research on natural populations. Ford's magnum opus was \"Ecological genetics\", which ran to four editions and was widely influential. \nOther notable ecological geneticists would include Theodosius Dobzhansky who worked on chromosome polymorphism in fruit flies. As a young researcher in Russia, Dobzhansky had been influenced by Sergei Chetverikov, who also deserves to be remembered as a founder of genetics in the field, though his significance was not appreciated until much later. Dobzhansky and colleagues carried out studies on natural populations of \"Drosophila\" species in western USA and Mexico over many years.\nMany were influenced by Ford in the post WWII era. Collectively, their work on lepidoptera, and on human blood groups, established the field, and threw light on selection in natural populations, where its role had been once doubted.\nWork of this kind needs long-term funding, as well as grounding in both ecology and genetics. These are both difficult requirements. Research projects can last longer than a researcher's career; for instance, research into mimicry started 150 years ago, and is still going strongly. Funding of this type of research is still rather erratic, but at least the value of working with natural populations in the field cannot now be doubted."}

They include primrose, cowslip and oxlip. \nMany species are grown for their ornamental flowers. They are native to the temperate Northern Hemisphere, south into tropical mountains in Ethiopia, Indonesia and New Guinea, and in temperate southern South America.\nPerennial primulas bloom mostly during the spring; their flowers can be purple, yellow, red, pink, or white. Generally, they prefer filtered sunlight. Many species are adapted to alpine climates.\nThe word \"primula\" is the Latin feminine diminutive of \"primus\", meaning first (prime), applied to flowers that are among the first to open in spring. \nPrimroses are used as food plants by the larvae (caterpillars) of some Lepidoptera species.\nSome flowering forms of (cultivated) \"Primula\" are commonly known as polyanthus (\"P. elatior\" hybrids) as opposite to primrose (\"P. vulgaris\" hybrids).\nHeterostyly.\nThe common primrose, \"Primula vulgaris\", shows heterostyly. This is a type of morphism with flower forms which differ in the lengths of the pistil and stamens.\nThe morph phenotype is genetically closely linked to genes responsible for a system of self-incompatibility. That means the pollen from a flower on one morph cannot fertilize another flower of the same morph. \nIn one morph (termed 'pin') the stamens are short and the pistils are long; in the second morph (termed 'thrum') the stamens are long and the pistils are short. The length of the pistil in one morph equals the length of the stamens in the second morph, and vice versa. The system prevents self-fertilisation.\nAll sections of the genus \"Primula\" have heterostyle species, altogether 354 species out of 419. Since heterostyly is characteristic of nearly all races or species, the system is at least as old as the genus."}

The French and British attacked the Chinese city of Canton. The city fell on January 1, 1858 and the Europeans took over.\nBackground.\nThe Second Opium War was a conflict between England and China. Other Western countries, including the Russian Empire, the United States, and the Second French Empire helped the English. The War began after an event called the \"\"Arrow\" incident.\" The English used the incident as an excuse to start the war. The Second Opium War is sometimes called the \"Arrow War.\"\nThe English had several goals in the war. Some of these were:\nIn 1856, the Qing Dynasty only let foreign merchants trade in certain cities. Goods like tea and silk had to be shipped to those trade cities, and were taxed on the way. The English did not want to pay the extra taxes for shipping things across China.\nThe Chinese had executed a French missionary named Father August Chapdelaine in Guangxi province. This made the French very angry. The French joined the English in fighting the Chinese.\nOn October 8, 1856, the Chinese arrested 12 crewmembers of a ship named \"Arrow\". The Chinese authorities believed that the \"Arrow\" was smuggling salt. The \"Arrow\" was owned by Chinese people, but it was registered with the British. Harry Smith Parkes was the British Consul in Canton. He sent a letter to the Chinese Imperial Commissioner (governor), Ye Mingchen. Ye replied that the \"Arrow\" was a Chinese ship. He claimed that Parkes and the British had no jurisdiction (no right to interfere.) Ye offered to return the arrested sailors, but Parkes refused. Parkes demanded an apology for the insult. Ye replied there was no need for an apology because there was no insult. The British decided that the Supplementary Treaty of the Bogue had been broken. On October 27, 1856, the British Royal Navy attacked Canton.\nBattle of Canton (1856).\nThe first battle of Canton started on October 23, 1856. Three English warships entered the Bocca Tigris (), the waterway that leads to Canton. The English captured the forts that were protecting the city. Ye saw the warships, but did not want to fight them. He moved his navy back away from the English ships.\nOn October 25, the English navy surrounded the city. Ye ordered all trade with the English to stop.\nAdmiral Michael Seymour, the commander of the British navy, sent Ye a message on October 27. Seymour demanded that the English be allowed to enter Canton. (Before this, foreigners could not enter the city itself. If they wanted to do business or trade they had to do so in the suburbs or harbor.) Ye did not answer. Seymour ordered his ships to shoot at the government offices. Ye made a declaration that he would pay 30 pieces of silver for each English person killed.\nYe still had not answered on October 28. The English artillery attacked and destroyed the Southern wall of Canton. English soldiers invaded Ye's yamun (office.) The soldiers wanted to capture Ye, but they could not find him. The English occupied (stayed in) Canton for a short while. They had to leave because they did not have enough soldiers or resources to keep control of the city.\nBattle of Canton.\nWhen the news was sent to London, the English government had a big argument on whether to wage war against China. The disagreement passed by 110:146, the proposal (suggestion) was veto (not to agree with the political case). But the English prime minister Palmerston the House of Commons and restarted the election. His party won the election, so the policy passed. The English government ordered (command) Lord Elgin to be a new diplomat with China.\nJust in time, the French government said their churchman were killed by the Chinese government. Because the French minister (a man who says what his country said) always had (to be refused), it joined the English government and sent armies. English and French armies entered into an alliance (becoming allies and working together).\nIn the mid of October, 1857. The English army general had a plan to invade China. They decided to attack from the south of China, Canton. They would then proceed to attack along the North of China, and proceed to keep moving towards Peking.\nBefore they went, the Russian minister advised them that only occupying Canton would not make the Qing dynasty give up, and that the better way to make them give in would be by moving onward to Peking. However, the English-French armies still stuck with their first decision, which was to attack Canton. Lord Elgin talked with Seymour and the other generals about their plan to Canton. They were certain that they could take (to occupy) Canton.\nIn November. The English held down the Indian Revolution successfully. Therefore, they had an army large enough to send towards China. The alliance army prepared 10,000 soldiers. In Navy, the English army had 43 warships and the French army had 10 ships.\nOn December 10, 1857. Canton was blocked. On December 12, the alliance army made their last warning to Ye and made several demands that are as followed:\nOn December 14, Ye refused them. After 12 days, The English and French ministers responded by stating that their army are now free to do as they wish. At the same time, the English naval commander sent messages to Ye. This time, he demanded the Qing army to retreat 90 miles away from Canton within 2 days. In the end, Ye still refused. Over the course of those 2 days, they took no action.\nOn December 27, which was the day before the battle, Ye sent messages to his king, the Xianfeng Emperor. He lied to the emperor about their circumstances. In the letter, he stated that the English had begun to beg for peace, and that they only wanted to trade with China, said Yeh:\nIn December 28, the war begun. The alliance army sent troops which consisted of about 5,500 men, 700 French soldiers, and an additional 20 warships. They landed near Canton and approached the city. The alliance army opened fire at the governor's office (Yeh's workplace). The Qing army retreated, but Ye was still sitting on his office and reading the paper.\nFall of Canton.\nOn December 29, the government office finally was destroyed by . The wall of Canton was also lost to the war. Around 2 p.m. in the afternoon., the battle ended. The English-French armies emerged victorious and occupied Canton, and 15 casualties were reported.\nOn January 5, after the occupation of Canton, Ye was unwilling to leave and was caught in by the English army. The English brought Ye on their ship to Kolkata, India."}

It is a performing arts college. The school teaches in drama, music and dance. It used to be a grammar School and a technical school. The school started by Samuel Brunts in 1709. One of its former students, Rebecca Addlington, won two gold medals in the 2008 Summer Olympics.\nHistory.\nThe Brunts Academy started as primary/first school in 1687. It had funds of 100 pounds. This was a large amount of money at the time. In 1709, Samuel Brunts' will said that he wanted the local children to \"learn an Honest Trade\" and get a good job. This led to the Brunts' estate having up with 40 boys and girls learning reading, writing and maths by 1831. The girls also learned knitting and sewing. 60 years later, the estate and the school were combined. In 1891, the school was called Brunts Technical School.\nIn 1830 \"Brunts Charity\" owned buildings and land in East Bridgford, Nottingham's marketplace and at Claypool in Lincolnshire. It was the richest of all the charitable organisations in Mansfield in 1832. \nA new building was built in 1891. In 1976, Brunts Grammar School became a secondary/second school.\nIn 2012, the name changed to The Brunts Academy.\nToday.\nThe school's students come from several schools known as 'the family of schools'. They include King Edward School, Sutton Road School, St Peter's (C of E) School, High Oakham School and Newgate Primary School.\nThe school's uniform has a green blazer/jacket. The school colours are green and gold. Its logo is a griffin with its back two legs inside a shield. The shield has \"Nil Mortalibus Ardui Est\" around the logo. This is the school's Latin motto. It means \"nothing is impossible for humankind\".\nIn 2002, there were nearly 1500 students in the school. Only a small number of the students were aged 16 years or below. The school gained 57% A-C passes. Only a small amount of the students did not pass. This was 5% higher than the England average and 10% better than the United Kingdom average.\nThe school is known for having a large number of white students compared with the national average. Nearly all of its students are from England. "}

It is the town church of Themar in Thuringia. It is dedicated to St Bartholomew. It belongs to the most richly equipped churches of the upper valley of the Werra. It is one of the few buildings of the small town, first mentioned in 796, which outlasted all storms of the time. The Oberkirche (upper church) at the upper gate and the Unterkirche (lower church) at the Werra were the first places of worship in the place. Of the Roman Unterkirche there still exist some remainders in the vestry and in both lower floors of the church tower. Pope Sixtus IV gave permission for the restoration of the church on May 14, 1484 with countess Margaretha von Henneberg intermediating.\nOn May 3, 1488 the Chorherr (canon regular) of the Premonstratensian monastery Ve\u00dfra and minister of Themar Antonius K\u00f6nig founded the building of today's church. In 1502 the hall church was completed. It is in late Gothic style.\nThe Protestant Reformation was introduced to Themar on October 5, 1544 by the count Ernst von Henneberg. After the Reformation the church received several smaller carved altars from other churches. Since 1541 the church building was frequently converted in the course of the next decades.\nThe barrel vault and the two matroneums were inserted, whose support beams were decorated with beautiful\" Bartmannsk\u00f6pfe\" (sculptures). Similar sculptures can be found in the churches of Rohr and Herpf near Meiningen.\nAt the columns the matroneums were decorated with sculptures of saints and apostles, partially from older Gothic altar works and with famous verses from the bible.\nThe Marienaltar.\nIn the choir area there is the valuable \"Marienaltar\" (altar of St Mary), which was created by Hans Nu\u00dfbaum from Bamberg in about 1510.\nThe altar shows Maria with Jesus as a child in the center, archangel Michael to her side, killing the dragon with his lance, and St Bartholomew, the patron of church and town.\nOn the side panels of the altar there are stations from the life of St Mary: The announcement to the Virgin Mary, the birth of the Lord, the three Magi and the Lamentation of St. Mary by the apostles. At the back of the side panels there are paintings of St Barbara, St Dorothy, St Margaret, St Catherine. On the Predella of the altar is to be seen the Holy Kinship.\nApart from its artistic value the Marienaltar has also great importance for local history: It retained the town church in the Thirty Years' War of being burned down. After the defeat of Sweden in the battle of N\u00f6rdlingen (1634) general Johann Ludwig Hektor of Isolani, \u201ethe commander of all Croats\u201c, plundered the countries of the Thuringian princes.\nOn October 16 (Saint Gall's Day) in 1634, Themar was burned down (on the same day as Suhl) after the plundering by the Croats. The town church would have been burned as well, but a pious Italian officer gave the order to extinguish the fire when it came near to the Marienaltar.\nFurther carvings and art treasures are: The shrine of the apostles (about 1500). This is called \"\u201eNasenaltar\"\" (nose altar), and is popular because of the expressive faces of the apostles.\nAt the back of the side panels there is a painting of the \"Apostelabschied\" (Great Commission). At the north wall there is the Wallfahrtsaltar (altar of pilgrimage) one can see the \"H\u00fchnchenlegende\" (miracle of the chicken) of Santo Domingo de la Calzada (on the way of St James) at the back of a side panel.\nAt the south wall there are a Piet\u00e0 altar and a Gothic \"Mondsichelmadonna\", and in the choir area an epitaph in the Renaissance style. Furthermore, a fresco painting representing St. Catherine, that was detected in 1934, then the richly decorated Schalldeckel (abat-voix, or sounding-board) of the pulpit that dates from 1644 and an \"Epistelstuhl\" (reading-desk) likewise from the center of the 17th century and some paintings.\nAbout 1900 stained glass was donated for the windows in the choir area. The pictures show Biblical scenes: the prodigal or lost son, the \"Kindersegnung\" (benediction of children, St. Luke 18, 15-17), the Good Samaritan. 1972 The last renovation of the St Bartholomew's Church was in 1972.\nThe organ.\nOriginally the organ of the town church was set up in 1851 at the east wall of the church nave by the organ-builders Johann Michel and Wilhelm Holland (from Schmiedefeld am Rennsteig). Three organ stops of the pedal division were taken over from the Weise-organ built in 1629. In 1866 the organ was moved to the extended second matroneum in the west and renewed and reorganized for the last time in the years 1999/2000 by the company R\u00f6sel and Hercher.\nFrom 1668 to 1684 Georg Christoph Bach, the oldest uncle of Johann Sebastian Bach, worked as Kantor at the town church and as a teacher at the Latin school of Themar. In 1684 he was appointed to Schweinfurt and became the ancestor of the Schweinfurt branch of the Bach family.\nThe tower.\nThe church tower in Renaissance style contains three bells. The oldest bell was cast in 1488, another in 1507. The Bartholom\u00e4us bell that was cast in 1520 had to be delivered in 1942. In 1955 a steel bell was put in instead. In the church tower there lived a family of tower guards called Rust up to the fifties of the last century. The three rooms of their flat and the winch which helped to wind up food, water and coal up to the flat are to be still seen there."}

The banded layers are a common feature in sediments for much of the Earth's early history.\nRelation to atmospheric oxygenation.\nThe formations are abundant around the time of the Great Oxygenation Event, 2,400 mya. They become less common after 1,800 mya.\nThe total amount of oxygen locked up in the banded iron beds is estimated to be perhaps twenty times the volume of oxygen present in the modern atmosphere of Earth. Banded iron beds are an important commercial source of iron ore, such as the Pilbara region of Western Australia, the Animikie Group in Minnesota and Caraj\u00e1s Mineral Province in Brazil.\nOrigins.\nThe conventional concept is that the \"banded iron\" layers were formed in sea water as the result of oxygen released by photosynthetic cyanobacteria. This combined with dissolved iron in Earth's oceans to form insoluble iron oxides. These precipitated out, forming a thin layer on the substrate, which may have been anoxic mud (forming shale and chert). Each band is similar to a varve: the banding is assumed to result from cyclic variations in available oxygen.\nIt is assumed that the Earth started out with vast amounts of iron dissolved in the world's acidic seas. Iron is much more soluble than its oxides.\nEventually, as photosynthetic organisms generated oxygen, the available iron in the Earth's oceans was precipitated out as iron oxides.\nAt the tipping point where the oceans became permanently oxygenated, small variations in oxygen production produced pulses of free oxygen in the surface waters, alternating with pulses of iron oxide deposition."}

Cratons can be described as shields, in which the basement rock crops out at the surface, and platforms, in which the basement is overlain by sediments and sedimentary rock.\nCratons are subdivided geographically into geologic provinces. A geologic province is an area with common geologic properties."}

He was a soldier in the Roman army when the emperor Claudius Gothicus promoted him to high rank. When Claudius died, his army chose Aurelian as the next emperor. Aurelian overcame a number of rebellions. His armies overcame the armies of the Gallic Empire and the Palmyrene Empire (two Roman states that formed during the Crisis of the Third Century). Aurelian joined the Roman Empire into one state again, and this was the beginning of the end of the Crisis of the Third Century. \nWhile he was emperor, Aurelian overcame the armies of several groups of barbarians \u2013 the Goths, Vandals, Juthungi, Sarmatians, and Carpi. Aurelian increased the importance the god Sol Invictus in Roman religion and he built a temple for the god in the city of Rome. For the first time in many centuries, Rome needed a defensive wall to keep out enemies who might attack it. Aurelian's government started to build the Aurelian Walls around Rome. Aurelian's wife, Ulpia Severina, was his (empress) after summer 274. Aurelian was murdered by some of his soldiers in autumn 275.\nEarly life.\nThe \"Calendar of Philocalus\" and the Greek historian John Malalas say that Aurelian was born on the 9 September 214. Aurelian was probably not from the nobility.\nAurelian was a soldier. He was (a general officer with a high rank) when Claudius Gothicus was emperor. Claudius Gothicus died in Sirmium (now Sremska Mitrovica, Serbia) in September 270 (or on 30 August).\nEmperor.\n270\u2013272.\nAurelian became emperor at Sirmium in September 270. Then Aurelian's army overcame Quintillus's army in a battle at Aquileia. (Quintillus was the emperor and the brother of Claudius Gothicus, the previous emperor.) Latin histories (the \"Epitome de Caesaribus\" and the work of Eutropius) say that Aurelian was emperor for five years and six months. This means that Aurelian may have started a rebellion against Claudius in February or March 270. However, this is not in the Roman histories. The Roman calendar had a festival for the anniversary of Aurelian's accession as emperor. It was on the day that Claudius Gothicus died.\nFor the first winter (270\u2013271) of his reign, Aurelian was in Rome. Felicissimus, a \"rationalis\" (an official in the mint) in Rome started a rebellion in the city, possibly in this first winter. Felicissimus did not have success. In 271 Aurelian was Roman consul for the first time. That year, he undertook military campaigns against the Vandals, Juthungi, and Sarmatians. Aurelian got the name because of his victories over Germanic peoples. He was again in Rome for his second winter (271\u2013272) as emperor. It was at this time that the Romans began to build new defensive walls around the city: the Aurelian Walls.\nThe Greek historian Zosimus wrote that at some time in 271 or 272, Aurelian overcame a rebellion by Domitianus. Zosimus also wrote that around the same time, Aurelian overcame another rebellion by Urbanus. Both Zosimus and the \"Epitome de Caesaribus\" write that Septimius started another rebellion in Dalmatia. Septimius's own soldiers killed him.\n272\u2013273.\nIn 272, Aurelian moved to the eastern Roman Empire. He fought against the Goths in the Balkans. Aurelian got the name because of his victories over the Goths. Aurelian ordered that Roman Dacia should be evacuated, and the Romans gave him the unofficial name of . Then he moved further east and overcame Zenobia in war. Aurelian took control of Palmyra in summer 272. Because of his victories in the east \u2013 against the Persians, in Arabia, and at Palmyra \u2013 Aurelian got the names (or ); ; and . From 272, Aurelian also had the title . The writing of the Justinianic Code makes it possible that Aurelian was in Byzantium during winter 272\u2013273.\n273\u2013275.\nIn 273 Aurelian fought a war against the Carpi. His victories meant that Aurelian got the name . That year, Aurelian also fought a second campaign against the armies of Palmyra. The \"Historia Augusta\" (a Latin history) says that during 273, Firmus, a rich man from Seleucia Pieria, started a rebellion against Aurelian. Firmus did not say that he was the emperor. His rebellion did not have success. The Greek historian Zosimus writes that Aurelian held a triumph in Rome to celebrate his victories.\nIn 274, Aurelian was Roman consul for the second time. In the middle of 274, Aurelian overcame the armies of Tetricus. At this Tetricus's rebel Gallic Empire came to its end. The writings of Aurelius Victor say that in autumn that year Aurelian held another Roman triumph. The Romans called Aurelian . That year, probably on the 29 August 274, Aurelian's wife Ulpia Severina became \"augusta\" (empress). In the same year, Aurelian dedicated the new Temple of the Sun in Rome to the god Sol Invictus, possibly on 25 December, the winter solstice. Aurelian was Roman consul for the third time in 275. In 275, Aurelian set out through Gaul and passed Vindelicia on his way to the Roman lands around the Danube.\nDeath.\nOn his way east in September 275 (or possibly in October), soldiers in Aurelian's army killed Aurelian at Caenophrurium. Caenophrurium was a place between Perinthus and Byzantium in Roman Thracia. There may have been a \"damnatio memoriae\" on Aurelian: his name was removed from some inscriptions. However, the Romans later deified Aurelian (making him into a god). He got a new name in . Aurelian's wife, the \"augusta\" Ulpia Severina, may have been in control of the government until Marcus Claudius Tacitus became emperor.\nFamily.\nAurelian and Ulpia Severina married at an unknown date. She was the daughter of a man named Ulpius Crinitus. The \"Historia Augusta\" says that Aurelian and Ulpia Severina had a daughter together. After 29 August 274, Ulpia Severina became \"augusta\" (empress) and had the Latin title: . When Ulpia Severina died is unknown.\nAurelian had a sister. She is in the Latin histories (the \"Historia Augusta\", Eutropius, and the \"Epitome de Caesaribus\") but her name is unknown."}

In these books, the primary action happens during armed combat. Other war novels take place on the home front. The characters may be busy getting ready for or recovering from war. It is sometimes called military fiction.\nHistory.\nThere have been war novels and other stories about war for many thousands of years. In Ancient Greece and Rome and the Middle Ages, people wrote epic poems about the glory of war. Some of the most famous epic poems are \"The Iliad\" by Homer, \"The Aeneid\" by Virgil, the Old English saga \"Beowulf\", and the legends of King Arthur.\nAnother important influence of war novels are tragedies (plays about human suffering.) Euripides, Seneca the Younger, Christopher Marlowe, and William Shakespeare wrote plays that are important influences on war novels. Shakespeare's play \"Henry V\" has many features of a war novel. It has history and military tactics, and it talks about the ethics of war. \nThe genres of romance and satire are also important. These works, especially in Early Modern Europe, show military heroism and folly (foolishness). Some important examples are \"The Faerie Queen\" by Edmund Spenser and \"Don Quixote\" by Miguel de Cervantes.\nThe themes and symbols found in modern war novels are also influenced by older works. In \"The Inferno\", Dante described Hell in a way that is very close to how war is described in war novels. Other influences are John Milton's \"Paradise Lost\" and the Apocalypse in the \"Book of Revelation\" in the Bible.\nOrigins.\nThe first war novels were from the 1600s. At that time fiction novels written in prose (instead of poetry) were becoming popular. These early war novels were usually satires and picaresque novels. The soldier was usually a rogue and not very realistic. One example is \"Simplicissimus\" by Hans Jakob Christoffel von Grimmelshausen. \"Simplicissimus\" is a semi-autobiographical novel (based on the author's life) about the Thirty Years' War.\n19th century war novels.\nInfluential war novels from this time include Leo Tolstoy's \"War and Peace\", about the Napoleonic Wars in Russia, and Stephen Crane's \"The Red Badge of Courage\", about the American Civil War.\nWorld War I and after.\nWar novels from this time included the experiences of trench warfare, but also began to tell the stories of what happened at home during the war. Many novels were written about the war. Writers were from countries on all sides of the conflict.\nOne of the first and most influential of these was the 1916 novel \"Le Feu\" (or \"Under Fire\") by the French novelist and soldier Henri Barbusse.\nThe 1920s saw the so-called \"war book boom,\" during which many men who had fought during the war were finally ready to write openly and critically about their war experiences. In 1929, Erich Maria Remarque's \"All Quiet on the Western Front\" was a massive, worldwide bestseller. Also significant were Ernest Hemingway's \"A Farewell to Arms\" (1929), Richard Aldington's \"Death of a Hero\" (1929), Arnold Zweig's \"The Case of Sergeant Grischa\" (1927), Charles Yale Harrison's \"Generals Die in Bed\" (1930) and William March's \"Company K\" (1933).\nWorld War II and after.\nMany novels came out of soldiers' and peoples' experiences during World War II. These books were not only by European authors, but also by people around the world.\nJapanese war novels.\nJust after the war ended, Sakaguchi Ango (\u5742\u53e3\u5b89\u543e) published a book called \"Idiocy\" (\u767d\u75f4) about the strange life in Japan after the bombing and losing the war. There were many novels aout the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, including: \"Summer Flowers\" (\u590f\u306e\u82b1) by Hara Tamiki (\u539f \u6c11\u559c) in 1947 and \"Black Rain\" (\u9ed2\u3044\u96e8) by Ibuse Masuji (\u4e95\u4f0f\u9c52\u4e8c). There were also novels about being part of the kamikaze. The 1949 book \"Last Friends\" (\u304d\u3051\u3001\u308f\u3060\u3064\u307f\u306e\u58f0) was about a group of soldiers leaving for the front. It was a best-seller. Around 1970 another type of novel began to appear. Ordinary people wrote about their experiences of battles and air raids. Novels about the many different ways the war ended also began to appear and tell being left behind in China or becoming prisoners of the Soviet Union in Siberia.\nVietnam and after.\nMany Americans and Vietnamese authors wrote books during or after this long war."}

It came after the Archaean eon, and lasted from 2500 to 1600 million years ago (mya).\nIn the Palaeoproterozoic, there was a huge production of stromatolites by cyanobacteria. The first unicellular eukaryote organisms also appeared in the fossil record.\nThe first supercontinent grew, and some of the rocks were normal sedimentary rocks, not metamorphosed.\nBasic differences in Earth physics.\nBecause the Earth was only half as old as now, there were some basic differences from today. Heat in the Earth's interior was greater than today. This was mainly due to the higher abundance of radioactive isotopes, which decay as time passes.\nTemperatures at the surface were also higher, due to radiation from the Earth's interior, and due to a methane and carbon dioxide-based greenhouse atmosphere. During the previous eon, the Archaean, the oceans were hot (55\u201385\u00a0\u00b0C). This was only partly balanced by the fact that the Sun's radiation was lower at that time.\nPaleontological evidence on the Earth's rotational history suggests that ~1.8 billion years ago, there were about 450 days in a year, implying 20 hour days. Further back, the Earth day had about 17 hours, and there were 514\u00b133 days per year. The Earth\u2013Moon distance for the earliest Palaeoproterozoic was 51.9\u00b13.3 Earth radii (compared to 60.27 at present).\nSupercontinent.\nA global supercontinent (called Columbia, or Nena) existed from about 1.8 to 1.5 billion years ago in the Palaeoproterozoic era.\nClimate.\nDuring the era climate changes were as severe as any in Earth history. From a global high temperature at the start, there were three massive ice ages, with ice deep into the tropics.\nDrop in methane.\nThere are clear indications that the era saw a drop in atmospheric methane:\nThe buildup of oxygen.\nOxygen was produced by the cyanobacteria, but it was mostly used up by chemical sinks. These were the unoxidized sulfur and iron. Until roughly 2.3 billion years ago, oxygen was probably only 1% to 2% of its current level.p323\nBanded iron formations, which provide most of the world's iron ore, were formed by the oxygen forming compounds with iron; most accumulation ceased after 1.9 billion years ago. Red beds, which are colored by hematite, indicate an increase in atmospheric oxygen after 2 billion years ago; they are not found in older rocks.p324\nIce ages.\nThere were three major ice ages, with ice deep into the tropics. Undoubtedly, they happened as a result of reduced greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, and the rise of oxygen production.\nThere is what researchers call \"a puzzling interval of ~1,400 million years with no verified glaciation between early Palaeoproterozoic glaciations at 2400\u20132200 mya in North America, South Africa, Scandinavia and Australia and the Neoproterozoic glaciations that affected all continents at 800\u2013600 mya\".\nMeteorite strikes.\nThere were major bolide impacts during the era, two of which caused the largest impact crators on Earth. There are also three smaller (equal or more than 30 kilometers diameter) in the time zone of 3.0 to 1.2 billion years ago.\nOrigin of eukaryotes.\nThe origin of the eukaryotic cell was a milestone in the evolution of life, since they include all complex cells and almost all multi-cellular organisms. The timing of this series of events is hard to determine; Knoll suggests they developed approximately 1.6\u20132.1 billion years ago. Some acritarchs are known from at least 1650 million years ago, and the possible alga \"Grypania\" has been found as far back as 2100 million years ago."}

In 2010 one of the Kelly paintings was given to the National Gallery of Victoria. One of the Kelly paintings not owned by the museum was sold in March 2010 for AU$5.4 million. This was the highest price ever paid for an Australian painting. \nNolan was born in Carlton, Victoria on 22 April 1917. He attended Prahran Technical College and studied art at the National Gallery School in Melbourne. In 1948 he moved to Sydney, New South Wales and then in 1953 he moved to London where he stayed until his death on 28 November 1992."}

After the Victorian gold rush, it was easily the richest part of Australia, and Melbourne the largest city. Generous gifts from rich citizens, including the industrialist Alfred Felton, made it possible for the National Gallery to start buying large collections of overseas works from both old and modern masters.

It was a conservative newspaper for most of its history, but in 1949 became more left in its stories.\nHistory.\nThe newspaper was started by William Kerr, a journalist who had worked with the \"Sydney Gazette\" before moving to Melbourne in 1839 to work on John Pascoe Fawkner's \"Port Phillip Patriot\". The first edition was published on 2 June 1846.\nThe paper was known for its abuse and sarcasm and by 1853 Kerr lost ownership after a series of court actions. It was then published under the name of Edward Wilson. The paper was also linked to the weekly \"The Australasian\" which was to become \"The Australasian Post\" in 1946.\nDuring the Great Depression in 1933 it launched the \"Melbourne Evening Star\" in competition with \"The Herald\" newspaper, but was closed in 1936.\nIn 1949 the paper was bought by the London based \"Daily Mirror\" newspaper group. On 28 July 1952 the Melbourne Argus became the first newspaper in the world to publish colour photographs in a daily paper. The paper had interests in radio and in 1956, the new medium of television broadcasting. It was part of the group \"General Telecasters Victoria\" (GTV), and the GTV-9 television station. In 1957 the paper was sold to the Herald and Weekly Times group, which had been under the management of Chief Executive Keith Murdoch (Rupert's father) until his death in 1952. The Herald and Weekly Times group used the printing presses, but closed the \"Argus\" and sold off the broadcasting interests. The last edition was on 19 January 1957.\nThe Argus Building.\nThe \"Argus\" building, built in 1926 on the corner of La Trobe and Elizabeth streets, is classified by the National Trust and is on the Victorian Heritage Register of Heritage Victoria. In 1991, an innovative office building was built next door and named \"The Argus Centre\", an award winning building by Nonda Katsalidis. In 2004 La Trobe University bought the site of the old Argus building with the intention to redevelop and house legal and business schools in the building, as well as a ground floor shopping precinct."}

He was most successful in the 1940s in the black music market but he reached also white audiences and recorded several cross over hits in the Pop charts.\nLife.\nLouis Jordan was born in Brinkley,Arkansas. His mother, Addie, died in his younger years. His father, James Aron Jordan, was a music teacher and bandleader for the Brinkley Brass Band. From him he got his musical education. He started with the clarinet but also played piano very well.But the alto saxophon became his main instrument. He started his professionel career in the bands of his father.\nHe went north to Philadelphia and later to New York, where he started in 1932 with the band of Clarence Williams. In late 1936 he was invited to join the important Savoy Ballroom orchestra led by drummer Chick Webb.Webb was an excellent musician but no great showman, so Jordan took over the announcements when he started singing for the band. Later the young Ella Fitzgerald joined Webbs band and she often sang duets with Jordan. The following years she recorded some hit singles with Jordan.\n1938 Jordan was fired by Webb and he began to form an own band which made her first recordings for Decca in December 1938. The original lineup of the sextet was Jordan (saxes, vocals), Courtney Williams (trumpet), Lem Johnson (tenor sax), Clarence Johnson (piano), Charlie Drayton (bass) and Walter Martin (drums). The Decca recordings were from \"The Elks Rendezvous Band\" but Jordan changed the name to \"Tympany Five\" after the brand of Martins drums. The most successful time of the band was between 1942 and 1950. In this period they had 18 #1-hits in the Rhythm and Blues chart of Billboard magazine. Some of the hits like Caldonia, Let the good times roll, Saturday Night Fish Fry or Choo Choo Ch'Boogie are evergreens. Under his duet partners were Bing Crosby,Ella Fitzgerald and Louis Armstrong.\nIn the 1950s his singles did not sell very well so he left Decca. He signed with different other record companies but was not as successful as in the 1940s. He died in 1975 in Los Angeles and is buried in St. Louis, Missouri.\nLegacy.\nIn 2004, Rolling Stone Magazine ranked him #59 on their list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. He was introduced to the Rock and Roll Hall of fame. There he is described as \u201cthe Father of Rhythm &amp; Blues\u201d and \u201cthe Grandfather of Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll.\u201d As jump blues artist he paved the way for Roy Brown, Wynonie Harris, Tiny Bradshaw and others. In his music one can hear the prototype of Rock and Roll. He influenced Bill Haley &amp; His Comets, whose producer, Milt Gabler, had also worked with Jordan. The Broadway show, \"Five Guys Named Moe\", was devoted to Jordan's music and this title is given to both soundtrack (tribute) and original music collections. The show was played over 400 times on Broadway. Blues Guitarist B. B. King recorded an album called \"Let The Good Times Roll-The Music of Louis Jordan\", as well as the songs \"Let the Good Times Roll\" and \"Caldonia\". Rock singer Joe Jackson recorded Jumpin' Jive in 1981 which featured several songs by Jordan. Let The Good Times Roll, a Jordan biography, was written by British jazz historian John Chilton.\nAlbums.\nThe music of Louis Jordan is still available in many different collections. To learn more about his music one can buy Bear Familys nine-CD collection of Jordan's work (\"Let the Good Times Roll: the Complete Decca Recordings 1938-1954\"). Another collection is Proper Records low priced four-CD, 102-track compilation (\"Jivin' With Jordan\") that includes all of Jordan's important songs from his Decca years."}

These diseases may be caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, or parasites.\nZoonotic diseases are very common. About 60% of all infectious diseases in humans are spread by animals.\nZoonotic diseases can be spread in different ways. They may be spread from a sick animal directly to a human for example, through bites and infected saliva (like with rabies), or through the air. This is called \"direct zoonosis\".\nZoonotic diseases can also be spread through a vector. This is an animal that carries the pathogen that causes the disease without getting infected. Diseases like this are called \"vector-borne diseases\".\nSometimes the vector picks up the disease from another animal. For example, rats who have the bubonic plague do not directly infect humans. Instead, fleas bite the rats and pick up the bacteria that causes plague without getting sick. Then, if the flea bites a human, they can pass the bacteria on to the human, and the human can get the plague. The rat is the host of the disease, and the flea is the vector.\nTypes of zoonotic diseases.\nFoodborne illnesses.\nMany foodborne illnesses are zoonotic diseases. In these cases, a human gets infected by eating food that came from a sick animal, or one which had picked up a parasite.\nThe most common pathogens that cause foodborne illnesses are \"Salmonella\", \"Campylobacter\", and \"Escherichia coli\" (\"E. coli\") bacteria. Eggs, seafood, meat, poultry, and dairy products can all carry these bacteria and cause foodborne illnesses, like food poisoning, in humans.\nOther zoonotic illnesses that humans can get from eating or drinking include:\nOften, people can avoid foodborne illnesses by cooking meat, seafood, and eggs well enough to kill the bacteria or parasites in them.\nDirect zoonoses.\nBelow are some examples of zoonotic diseases that humans can get directly from sick, live animals."}

When touched or heated, it folds its leaves. \"Mimosa tenuiflora\" is used by shamans (traditional magical) healer. It is used in ayahuasca brews (a \"magic\" drink) because of the psychedelic drug N,N-Dimethyltryptamine DMT in its roots.\nGrouping.\nThe \"Mimosa\" genus has gone through many periods of time where it was split up into smallergroupings or lumped into larger ones. It has over 3,000 names to describe it and its species. Most of these names are now considered synonyms. Some of the names have been given to other species and genera.\nBecause of this, the name \"mimosa\" has been used for other species that look like mimosa but are not related. Some of the most common unrelated plants with this name are the silk tree (\"Albizia julibrissin\") and Sattle (\"Acacia dealbata\".)\nDescription.\nThis genus includes some plants that are able to move fast. This is very rare. The mimosa's leaves close quickly when touched.\n\"Mimosa\" is related to the genera \"Acacia\" and '[Albizia\". The difference between them is that the mimosa's flowers have ten or fewer stamens. The big round flower of the mimosa is actually an inflorescence, a cluster (close group) of many small flowers."}

There are several versions of it, including Co\u00f1o English, Jejenese and Swardspeak. There are attempts to differentiate the usage of Taglish and Englog where Taglish refers to the usage of English words in Tagalog syntax while Englog refers to the usage of Tagalog words in English syntax.\nTaglish and Englog are used by Filipinos in countries like Australia, Canada, the Republic of Ireland, New Zealand, the United States, and the United Kingdom. It used in text messages to write more quickly.\nCharacteristics.\nTaglish (or Englog) is a language of Manila created by mixing the English and the Tagalog languages together. The language is used because Tagalog words are longer than words in English. Example:\nEnglish action words, and even some naming words, can be Tagalog action words. This is done by the addition of one or more prefixes or infixes and by the doubling of the first sound of the starting form of the action or naming word.\nThe English action word \"drive\" can be changed to the Tagalog word \"magda-drive\" meaning \"will drive\" (used in place of the Tagalog word \"magmamaneho\"). The English naming word \"Internet\" can also be changed to the Tagalog word \"nag-Internet\" meaning \"have used the Internet\".\nTaglish and Englog also use sentences of mixed English or Tagalog words and phrases. The conjunctions used to connect them can come from eany of the two. Some examples include:\nBecause its informal nature, experts of English and Tagalog discourage its use.\nForms.\nJejenese.\nJejenese is the kind of speech used by people called \"Jejemons\". This is a subculture in the Philippines, made up of people who try to change the English language to better suit Spanish and Filipino. Their alphabet, Jejebet, is based on Leet. Words are created by mixing letters in a word, mixed large and small letters, using the letters H, X or Z many times, and mixing of numbers in words. The spelling is the same as in Leet.\nSwardspeak.\nSwardspeak is a kind of Taglish and Englog used by gay people. It is a form of slang. Swardspeak uses words from Tagalog, English, Spanish, Cebuano, Japanese, Sanskrit, and other languages. Names of Celebrities and trademark brands are also used.\nCo\u00f1o English.\nCo\u00f1o English (tl: \"Konyo\") or Colegiala English (es: ) is a creole of Taglish and Englog that originated from the children in rich families of Manila. The word \"co\u00f1o\" itself came from the Spanish word \"co\u00f1o\". It is a form of Philippine English that has Spanish and Tagalog words. Unlike other forms of Taglish and Englog, Co\u00f1o English sounds more gentle and feminine.\nThe most common aspect of Co\u00f1o English is the building of action words using the English action word \"make\" with the base form of a Tagalog action word. Examples:\nSometimes, Tagalog interjections such as \"ano\", \"naman\", \"pa\", \"na\" (or \"nah\"), \"no\" (or \"noh\"), \"a\" (or \"ha\"), \"e\" (or \"eh\"), and \"o\" (or \"oh\") are placed to add emphasis.\n\"No\" and \"a\" (from the Tagalog word \"ano\") are used for questions and are added to the end of a sentence only. \"Ano\" (meaning \"what\") is also used for questions and is placed in the front or the end.\n\"E\" (added to answers to questions) and \"o\" (for statements) are used for exclamations and are added to the front only. \"Pa\" (meaning \"not yet\", \"not yet done\", \"to continue\", or \"still\") and \"na\" (meaning \"now\", \"already\", or \"already done\") can be placed in the middle or end. \"Naman\" (same as \"na\" but mostly for emphasis only) is placed anywhere.\nThe interjection \"no?\" (equal to the Spanish \"\u00bfno?\" and the German \"nicht?\") is pronounced as or (with a pure vowel instead of the English glide), which shows influence from Spanish.\nEnglish description words are often replaced with Tagalog action words. The language also has many Spanish words or Spanish words like \"ba\u00f1o\" (\"bathroom\"),\n\"tostado\" (\"toasted\") and \"jam\u00f3n\" (\"ham\").\nDue to the feminine sound of Co\u00f1o English, male speakers sometimes overuse the Tagalog word \"pare\" (which means \"pal\" or \"buddy\"), in order to make it sound more masculine. Sometimes \"tsong\" (whose meaning is the same) is used instead of \"pare\" or with it.Examples below:"}

It is caused by a parasite called \"Trichomonas vaginalis\", which is a protozoa made of just one cell. Trichomoniasis can affect both men and women. It is usually an infection of the urinary system and genitals.\nCause.\nThe \"Trichomonas vaginalis\" parasite can only live in the human genital tract. Trichomoniasis is only spread through sex, or if two people's genitals touch.\nSigns and symptoms.\nMost people with trichomoniasis do not have any symptoms. \nWhen people do have symptoms, they usually start about 5 to 28 days after the person got infected. Symptoms may include:\nComplications.\nComplications are serious problems that can happen because a person has a disease. These problems do not happen to everyone with trichomoniasis. They are the most serious problems that trichomoniasis can cause. Some of the most dangerous problems that can happen to a person with trichomoniasis include:\nTreatment.\nTreatment for trichomoniasis is usually metronidazole (Flagyl), which kills protozoa like \"Trichomonas vaginalis\". However, this medication has to be used carefully with woman who are in the early stages of pregnancy. Anyone the infected person has had sex with should also get treatment, even if they have no symptoms.\nAbout 95% to 97% of people with trichomoniasis are cured after one dose of metronidazole. \nWithout treatment, trichomoniasis can stay in a woman's body for months to years. In many (but not all) men, it seems to go away on its own.\nPrevention.\nTrichomoniasis can be prevented by having safe sex (for example, by using condoms).\nThe United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggests that women who are having vaginal discharge should get tested for trichomoniasis.\nHow common is trichomoniasis?\nTrichomoniasis is the most common sexually transmitted disease in the world that is not caused by a virus. Every year, about 248 million more people get trichomoniasis. It is more common in women than men. \nIt is also the most common non-viral sexually transmitted disease in the United States. In the U.S., about 3.7 million people have trichomoniasis, and about 1.1 million more people get infected every year. Recent research has said that 3% of the U.S. population (3 in every 100 people) have trichomoniasis.

The urinary tract or the intestines may be infected. Symptoms include abdominal pain, diarrhea, bloody stool, or blood in the urine. Those who have been infected for a long time may experience liver damage, kidney failure, infertility, or bladder cancer. In children, it may cause poor growth and learning difficulty.\nThe disease is caused by contact with fresh water containing the parasites. These parasites are from infected freshwater snails. The disease is very common among children in developing countries, as they are more likely to play in water. Other high-risk groups include farmers, fishermen, and people using unclean water. It is a helminth infections. Eggs of the parasite may be found in urine or stool. Antibodies may also be found in the blood.\nTo prevent the disease use clean water and reduce snails. The medicine praziquantel may be given once a year to everybody. This will decrease the number of people infected. Praziquantel is also the treatment recommended by the World Health Organization for those who are known to be infected.\nSchistosomiasis affected about 252 million people in 2015. An estimated 4,400 to 200,000 people die from it each year. The disease is mainly found in Africa, Asia, and South America.

He fought for Emperor Go-Daigo. The warrior's conduct and death are recognized as examples of bushido.\nBattle planner.\nKusunoki was a brilliant tactician and strategist. He defended two key Loyalist fortresses at Akasaka and Chihaya. This helped Go-Daigo to briefly return to power. However, one of the loyalist generals, Ashikaga Takauji, betrayed Go-Daigo. Ashikaga led an army against Kusunoki and the remaining loyalists. Kusunoki suggested to the Emperor that they hide on sacred Mount Hiei and allow Takauji to take Kyoto. Later, they could move quickly down from the mountain to trap Ashikaga and destroy him.\nDisaster.\nGo-Daigo would not leave the capital. He insisted that Kusunoki meet Ashikaga's larger army forces in the field in a direct battle. Kusunoki obediently accepted his Emperor's foolish command. This became a great example of loyalty. He left his death poem with his young son Masatsura and knowingly marched his army into almost certain death. The battle took place at Minatogawa in modern-day Ch\u016b\u014d-ku, Kobe. It was a tactical disaster. Kusunoki had only 73 of the original 700 horsemen left and was surrounded. He committed suicide along with his brother Masasue, 11 close clan members, and 60 others. According to legend, his brother's last words were \"Shichisei H\u014dkoku!\" (\u4e03\u751f\u5831\u570b; \"Would that I had seven lives to give for my country!\") and Kusunoki Masashige agreed.\nAfter his death.\nKusunoki Masashige's son, Kusunoki Masatsura, served the next emperor, the 12-year old Go-Murukami. These two had a trusting relationship like their fathers. Masatsura died alongside his brother Masatoki and cousin Wada Takahide in battle. That was the end of the Kusunoki clan.\nKusunoki Masashige's successful defense of Chihaya castle is believed to have helped the emperor gain power against the Kamakura bakufu. Kusunoki held out so long in his castle, so Ashikaga Takauji changed sides and helped the emperor. The Kamakura bakufu ended. However, Ashikaga Takauji quickly learned that he did not like following the emperor's commands. He changed loyalty again and established his own Ashikaga bakufu. He was able to establish his own shogunate after defeating Kusunoki Masashige and the commander in chief Yoshisada in the final battle. Kusunoki Masashige tried to bring Ashikaga Takauji back to the emperor's side, but the emperor rejected this plan.\nLegacy.\nKusunoki's life and death are an important part of the historical narrative which is recorded in the \"Taiheiki\"."}

The dynasty was founded in 1736 by the brilliant military commander Nader Shah, who deposed the last member of the Safavid dynasty and proclaimed himself as the Shah of Iran.\nAt its height it controlled modern-day Iran, Armenia, Georgia, Azerbaijan Republic, parts of the North Caucasus (Dagestan), Afghanistan, Bahrain, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Pakistan, and parts of Iraq, Turkey, United Arab Emirates and Oman. After his death, most of his empire was divided between the Zands, Durranis, Georgians, and the Caucasian khanates, while Afsharid rule was confined to a small local state in Khorasan. Finally, the Afsharid dynasty was overthrown by Mohammad Khan Qajar in 1796, who would establish a new native Iranian empire and restore Iranian suzerainty over several of the aforementioned regions.\nThe dynasty was named after the Turcoman Afshar tribe from Khorasan in north-east Iran, to which Nader belonged. The Afshars had originally migrated from Turkestan to Azerbaijan (Iranian Azerbaijan) in the 13th century. In the early 17th century, Shah Abbas the Great moved many Afshars from Azerbaijan to Khorasan to defend the north-eastern borders of his state against the Uzbeks, after which the Afshars settled in those regions.

It is done in a lab, using an enzyme called DNA polymerase. It is called chain reaction because the result of one cycle is used immediately for the next cycle. This allows exponential growth to happen. \nPCR has many uses in a biological or biochemical setting. Because DNA is unique for every living thing, experimenters can often extract only small amounts of the DNA they are interested in from a specimen. These amounts are usually too little to be useful, and so a scientist will use PCR to make enough copies to start experimenting with. For this reason, it is one of the most common techniques used in genetics labs around the world, making it useful in experiments on many things, including gene therapy, infectious diseases, and even forensics.\nThis process was developed in 1983 by Kary Mullis. He was not the first person to develop the PCR process, but he was the first to make the process usable. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work in the PCR process. It was a joint award, the other scientist being Michael Smith, who worked on a related project.\nPCR procedure.\nThe method consists of repeated heating and cooling, causing \"melting\" (separation of the two strands) and replication of the original DNA, also called a template. Short DNA fragments consisting of DNA sequences complementary to the ends of the template, called primers, and a DNA polymerase are key materials for selective and repetitive steps.\nThe technique proceeds in three steps:\nAfter the first cycle, there are 4 DNA strands. The process repeats with the 4 DNA strands, which will go on to make 8 strands, then repeat itself again to make 16 strands. In this way, PCR doubles the amount of DNA in a sample after each cycle, making it possible to obtain millions of copies of a DNA strand overnight."}

That province was in the northern part of Honshu. It was made from land taken from the indigenous Emishi. The province became the largest as it expanded to the north. The ancient capital was in modern Miyagi Prefecture.\nDuring the Sengoku period, various clans ruled different parts of the province. Date Masamune was a close ally of the Tokugawa. He established Sendai, which is now the largest town of the T\u014dhoku region.\nIn the Meiji period, four new provinces were created from parts of Mutsu: Rikuch\u016b, Rikuzen, Iwaki, and Iwashiro. In 1871, Sendai Prefecture was formed. It was renamed Miyagi prefecture the following year.\n2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami.\nOn March 11, 2011, a 9.0-magnitude earthquake and major tsunami hit Miyagi Prefecture.

It is about the experience in everyday life where people control the way that they appear to others. People do this by selecting certain gestures, speech patterns, feminine or masculine expressions, as well as certain expressions of class and cultural interest. This so that people can give a particular image to others about who they want to be and how they want to be seen.\nExamples.\nWhen gesturing a person might use reserved and minimal movements in a professional setting, whilst they may smile widely and wave about when with friends. A person might also change their speech pattern in a professional setting in order to sound more educated or refined, and may speak more casually or use swear words when in a casual setting. \nMales and females also often control how they are perceived in terms of masculinity or femininity. Boys and men might sometimes make their voices sound deeper or speak in short sentences to reflect an old stereotype that males are unfeeling and unconcerned with self-expression. Females on the other hand might feel the need to speak in line with the speech patterns of their peers, and this may include tacking on culturally specific phrases like \"or whatever\" and \"that's hot/cute\" to indicate they identify with the female gender and traditional interests. These of course are very simple ideas about what it means to be a man or woman. In contemporary life the border between male and female is sometimes becoming less strict. In Western societies psychologists support that people who show alternative gender expression are still medically normal.\nPeople also talk about what kind of music they are interested in, what kind of movies they like to watch, and what kind of places they like to visit in order to give people an idea of where they stand in relation to class and culture. A common distinction in contemporary youth culture is the listening to so called \"indie\" alternative or independent music as opposed to pop or popular music. Similarly someone might say they like watching highbrow French films or award winning films, as opposed to something more mass culture, like a Disney movie."}

Being a child of one of the \"Big Three\" (Zeus, Hades, Poseidon), Percy is the hero referred to within the prophecy of the Oracle, which foretells that the next half-blood child of the \"Big Three\" to reach the age of sixteen would have to make a decision that would mean the destruction or saving of Olympus. He also is called \u201cSeaweed brain\u201d, especially by Annabeth.\nAnnabeth Chase.\nAnnabeth Chase is a daughter of Athena. So, she is very intelligent. She is fascinated with architecture. In battle, she is a skilled enough fighter to fight along with Percy. She is very good in strategy. She ran away from home when she was seven and met Luke and Thalia, who took her with them to get to Camp Half-Blood. She aids Percy in four of his five quests and is captured in one of them.\nShe is also Percy's girlfriend.\nGrover Underwood.\nGrover Underwood is a satyr and Percy Jackson's best friend. He has found the four most powerful Greek demigods of the century: Percy Jackson (son of Poseidon), Thalia Grace (daughter of Zeus), and Nico and Bianca di Angelo (children of Hades). Before his death, Pan (the god of nature) says Grover is the bravest satyr ever to be. He names Grover as his successor to carry on his word to protect the wilderness. The Council of Cloven Elders is angered by this choice. He is the boyfriend of the tree nymph Juniper. But in \"The Last Olympian\" he is chosen as a replacement for Leneus (another Satyr who died in battle) on The Council of Cloven Elders after.\nTyson.\nTyson is a Cyclops, the son of Poseidon and his mother is unknown. Technically he is not a demigod, but at camp he lives in Percy's cabin, and is considered to be Percy's brother. He first appears in \"The Sea of Monsters\" as a homeless boy. He is afraid of Grover while Grover is also afraid of him. Also in \"The Sea of Monsters\" he was Percy's best friend and was always picked on. At the end of the book, he gets to go to work for his father, Poseidon, in the Underwater Armory.\nNico di Angelo.\nNico di Angelo is a son of Hades, Bianca's younger brother and Hazel Levesque half-brother and Percy Jackson and Thalia and Jason Grace's cousin. At first Percy assumed Hades broke the oath not to have children after World War II, but Nico and his sister Bianca had been placed in the Lotus Casino, where 'time stands still' since before the oath was made. At the time, he took great interest in a game called Mythomagic. Nico has the power to raise skeletal warriors, shadow travel, and create great fissures in the ground that swallow up anyone or anything unfortunate enough to be standing on it at the time. For a time, he was Percy's enemy, blaming him for the fact that he had failed to protect Bianca as he had promised, but they became friends eventually. Nico tried multiple times to contact his sister and had difficulty contacting her, even using his dreams. Nico refused to stay at Camp Half-Blood in the fourth book after noting that he was not welcomed at Camp Half-Blood; he compares this to the fact that his father is not welcomed at Olympus. Several months later, he informed Percy of a plan that could lead to defeating Kronos. In the final book of the first series, he convinced Percy to bathe in the River Styx, making him invincible barring the small of his back. In the end of the final book Percy makes all the gods and goddess to 'claim' all their children and make sure they have cabin's in Camp Half-blood. Nico goes back to the camp and finds a new hades cabin has been built for him and all the other minor gods and goddess. Later in the Heroes of Olympus series,he became captured by to giants [in mark of Athena] though he survived. Through out house of Hades and at the end of blood of Olympus,it is said that Nico has a crush on Percy,though he gives up that dream and goes to Will Solace,the son of Apollo,and in trials of Apollo they are seen as a couple.\nThalia Grace.\nThalia Grace is a daughter of Zeus. She is Jason's older sister and the cousin of Percy Jackson and Hazel Levesque and Bianca and Nico di Angelo. Grover Underwood was assigned to watch over her when she ran away from home at ten years old. On her journey, she met Luke Castellan and Annabeth Chase. They also had brief encounters with the Hunters of Artemis and she was enticed to join by Zo\u00eb Nightshade. When she was twelve, they were all soon attacked by a herd of monsters and caught by a Cyclops in New York. She was captured, but thanks to Annabeth, was freed. They meet the satyr Grover Underwood on the way. They escaped, but found that the monsters they had briefly escaped caught up to them. As they reached Half-Blood Hill, Thalia sent Luke, Grover, and Annabeth over the boundary line while she faced the monsters. She sacrificed her life for her friends, and her father, Zeus, took pity on her and transformed her to a pine tree. She is later brought back to life by the Golden Fleece and joins the quest in the third book where she ultimately joins the Hunters, taking the place of Zo\u00eb Nightshade. She has a younger brother, Jason Grace who was separated from her when she was 10. This became the reason she ran away from home.She wears a lot of dark makeup and punk style clothing. She has electric blue eyes and spiky black hair. She is so like Percy that according to Annabeth, they either could be best friends... or worst enemies.\nLuke Castellan.\nLuke Castellan is one of Hermes's children and a major antagonist of the series. Though initially the counselor of Cabin 11 and an ally to Percy, he revealed his true nature as a high-ranking member of Kronos's army by attempting to kill Percy at the end of \"The Lightning Thief\", and on several occasions afterward. He is shown to harbor a great bitterness towards the gods (particularly his father, Hermes) for what he regards as abandonment. His mother had been driven crazy upon attempting to become the Oracle, leading to a stressful childhood. After reforming, Kronos does not need Luke's assistance. However, in his duel with Percy on Mount Olympus, striking Annabeth reminds him of his promise to protect her. This temporarily frees him from Kronos's influence. Percy makes his choice to give Luke Annabeth's knife, and Luke, cursed by the broken promise, kills himself by stabbing his own Achilles heel to destroy Kronos. This fulfills the prophecy, with Luke being the foretold hero. In the film, Luke is portrayed by Jake Abel.\nPercy refers to Luke as a hero.\nMythological Characters.\nSome of the known characters of Greek Mythology have made an appearance in this series:\nNames.\nPercy is one of the few demigods whose last name does not reflect his godly parent, though his first name does. Many of the campers at Camp Half-Blood have last names that consist of a traditional role or trait of their parent. Other last names are often commonplace: Rodriguez, Nakamura."}

Operant conditioning deals with the voluntary modification of behaviour; classical conditioning with training a reflex.\nThorndike's law of effect.\nOperant conditioning, sometimes called \"instrumental learning\", was first studied by Edward L. Thorndike (1874\u20131949). He observed the behavior of cats trying to escape from home-made puzzle boxes. When first put in the boxes, cats took a long time to escape. With experience, successful responses occurred more frequently, enabling the cats to escape in less time. In his law of effect, Thorndike theorized that behaviours followed by satisfying consequences tend to be repeated, and those that produce unpleasant consequences are less likely to be repeated. In short, some consequences \"strengthened\" behavior and some consequences \"weakened\" behavior. Thorndike produced the first known learning curves by this procedure. \nB.F. Skinner (1904\u20131990) worked out a more detailed analysis of operant conditioning. Skinner invented the \"operant conditioning chamber\" which let him measure rate of response as a key dependent variable.

These spiders aggressively defend their territory and chase off attackers who may scare them by making a threat display. Next they will bite. The fastest death occurred in 1927 when a young boy died within fifteen minutes of being bitten. Thirteen deaths were recorded in the fifty years before antivenom was invented for this spider's bite. In English they are sometimes called Sydney Funnel Web spiders because they come from around that part of Australia.\nUnder the heading \"spiders\" (Aranae) there are three main groups. One is so very old that only a few species still live on earth. Another is the group that includes the spiders that can be seen making webs or chasing prey almost everywhere in the world. The third group includes the tarantulas and a few other kinds of spiders. The Atrax spiders belong to this third group.\nThere are also species called \"funnel-web spiders\" that belong to the second group mentioned above. So they are not close relatives of Atrax, and they are not dangerous. They just have a similar way of making a funnel-shaped web that leads down to some kind of shelter where the spider hides in wait for some insect to eat. Atrax is a very large and very aggressive spider, and these other spiders are from small to medium size and are extremely timid."}

He was attempting the rescue by ship of a friend and his family from the eruption of Mount Vesuvius. The eruption had just destroyed the cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum.\nPliny's \"Natural History\".\nThe \"Naturalis Historia\" is one of the largest works to have survived from the Roman Empire to the modern day. It claims to cover the entire field of ancient knowledge, based on the best authorities available to Pliny. He claims to be the only Roman ever to have undertaken such a work. It includes the fields of botany, zoology, astronomy, geology and mineralogy as well as the exploitation of those resources. It remains a standard work for the Roman period and the advances in technology and understanding of natural phenomena at the time. \nSome technical advances he discusses are the only sources for those inventions, such as hushing in mining technology or the use of water mills for crushing or grinding grain. Much of what he wrote about has been confirmed by archaeology. It is virtually the only work which describes the work of artists of the time, and is a reference work for the history of art.\nThe work became a model for all later encyclopedias in the breadth of subject matter examined, the need to reference original authors, and a comprehensive index list of the contents. The work is dedicated to the emperor Titus, son of Pliny's close friend, the emperor Vespasian, in the first year of Titus' reign. It is the only work by Pliny to have survived, and the last that he published, lacking a final revision at his sudden and unexpected death in the AD 79 eruption of Vesuvius.\nThe \"Natural History\" consists of 37\u00a0books. Pliny devised his own table of contents. The table below is a summary based on modern names for topics."}

The phrase \"Manifest Destiny\" was created in 1845 by a newspaper writer named John L. O'Sullivan. Quickly, the idea became very popular around America.\nDefinition.\nThe idea of Manifest Destiny told Americans that they had a mission, a special job given only to Americans. This mission was to make the United States bigger so the \"borders of freedom\" could be open to even more people. Only Americans could make sure that people living in not-free countries across the world could learn how to govern themselves and live freely in America.\nUse by President James Polk.\nIn 1845, James K. Polk was elected President. Polk believed very strongly in the idea of Manifest Destiny. During his Presidency, the United States grew by a million square miles.\nThe Mexican-American War.\nEver since he was running for President, Polk had talked about wanting the area that is now around Texas. At that time, Mexico controlled that land.\nIn June 1845, the United States decided to add Texas to the United States. President Polk sent the United States military to take over the area. The two sides fought for two years. Finally, Mexico surrendered. On February 2, 1848, it signed the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, which ended the war. It also gave the United States all of the land above the territory. This meant the United States had gained all of Texas, Arizona, and New Mexico; parts of Utah, Nevada, and Colorado; and northern California.\nA belief in Manifest Destiny helped convince Americans to support the war. It told them it was all right to fight, kill, and take land from Mexicans or other non-Americans. This was all right because they were only doing what God wanted. They were doing what they were destined to do.\nSettlement of the west.\nThe belief in Manifest Destiny was also important in encouraging people to go to other parts of the west, like Oregon and southern California.\nGrowth of the country.\nOf course, there were many other reasons, besides Manifest Destiny, that people wanted the United States to grow. More and more people were coming to America, especially to the cities, which were getting crowded. People wanted land of their own, instead of having to work for other people. The more land a person had, the more money they could make. If a person had their own land, they were working for themselves, and they were free.\nIf was a mixture of all these things, and many more, along with Manifest Destiny that caused the United States to grow this quickly in just 40 years:\nProblems.\nThe United States was very determined to take control of all of North America. Unfortunately, the parts of North America they wanted were not empty. They were places that Native Americans had always lived.\nThe United States government wanted these tribes to move outside the United States, to what is now Oklahoma. The government was able to convince some of these Native American tribes to sign treaties saying they would leave their lands.\nWhen some tribes refused to leave their lands, the United States government committed an ethnic cleansing against them. In an ethnic cleansing, ethnic or religious groups are forced to leave an area by a more powerful ethnic group. When the Cherokee Nation refused to leave their homes, United States President Martin van Buren ordered the military to make them leave.\nAbout 15,000 Cherokee were forced to walk to Oklahoma and Arkansas. Most historians think that about 4,000 of them died on the way. This was one out of every four people in the Cherokee population. Because so many people died, this forced migration is now called the Trail of Tears, and it is considered an ethnic cleansing."}

Tippoo's Tiger) is an 18th century moving model, musical instrument and an art object. It was made for Tipu, the ruler of Mysore in India. It shows a tiger killing a European soldier. It is in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.\nDescription.\nIt was made for Tipu Sultan of Mysore in about 1795. Tipu Sultan used the tiger as his emblem, The tiger was a symbol of power but it was also a symbol of royalty in India. Tipu was quoted as saying he would rather live two days as a tiger than 100 years as a sheep.\nThe turning of a handle powers mechanisms inside the model. Air is sent through a pipe that makes sound, like the cries of the victim. The pitch of the 'wail pipe' changes as the man's arm moves. Inside the tiger's head air is pushed through two pipes to make a tiger's roar. The ivory keyboard which operates an organ is hidden.\nThe type of brass shows it was made in India, but it may have been made by one of the Frenchman in Tipu's court. Some historians to suggest there was French input into the mechanism of this automaton.\nThe design is inspired by the death of Hugh Munro, son of General Sir Hector Munro, who had defeated Tipu in battle. Munro was killed by a tiger in 1792 on Saugor Island.&lt; Tipu saw this as a sign because he was called the \"Tiger\".\nThe model was obtained when the British captured Tipu's capital and killed him in 1799. Richard Wellesley wrote:\nThe East India Company decided not to give the Tiger to the Queen, but to keep it. It was displayed in the East India Company Museum in Leadenhall Street, London in 1808. The poet John Keats saw it there and included it in his satirical verse, \u201c\"The Cap and Bells\"\u201d. In the poem, a Soothsayer visits the court of the Emperor Elfinan.

Local residents asked the District government for help in the 1980s, because the current buildings were falling apart and many stores were empty. The United States Department of Housing and Urban Development decided in 2005 that the District government could not use federal money to buy Skyland because of past mistakes.\nThe District is working with the Rappaport Cos. and the William S.

It includes the area between K Street to the south, Rock Creek Park to the west and north, and New Hampshire Avenue and 21st Street to the east. The West End is so named because it was the westernmost part of the original Pierre L'Enfant plan for the city of Washington, before the annexation of Georgetown. It is home to the embassies of Qatar and Spain, as well as to the Egyptian Defense Office. The George Washington University and The George Washington University Medical Center are on the edge of the West End, at Washington Circle.\nIn the past, the West End had many vacant lots and old buildings. In 1972, the District's Office of Planning and Management wrote an urban renewal plan \"to bring life to a declining part of the city.\" Titled \"New Town for the West End,\" the aerial photograph on the cover of the study showed the area that was planned to become a \"new intown community.\" Today, the Ritz-Carlton Hotel and Residences, the Park Hyatt and Fairmont hotels, numerous luxury condominiums, and several of the city's best restaurants are in the West End. However, the Columbia Hospital for Women closed and became apartments.\nThe neighborhood is close to Georgetown, Foggy Bottom, Dupont Circle, the downtown business district, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the Kennedy Center, and the Watergate.\nHistory.\nHistorically, West End was a predominantly African-American community with brick Victorian rowhouses and warehouses. From 1880 until May 2002, the Columbia Hospital for Women provided care for women having babies. The hospital was important because other hospitals in the area (such as Arlington Hospital) refused to help African-American women having babies. The hospital closed and the building became apartments.\nRecent developments.\nMany new buildings are coming to West End, with hundreds of new luxury condominiums either under construction or in the planning phase.\nIn 2007, controversy began over the last remaining \"underdeveloped\" parcel of land, known as Square 37. Bordered by 23rd Street, 24th Street, L Street, and an alleyway, this is unusual because its short buildings from the 1800s to the 1960s, are different from the many new, tall buildings on the neighboring blocks. Square 37 was home to the Tiverton, the last remaining rent-controlled apartment building in the West End. The Tiverton tenants gained local media attention for successfully stopping people who wanted to build new buildings on Square 37.\nThe DC Council passed controversial emergency legislation on July 10, 2007 to sell the West End public library branch, the DC Special Operations Police Station (both on Square 37), and a firehouse (on neighboring Square 50) to the developer called Eastbanc.\nEducation.\nDistrict of Columbia Public Schools operates Francis-Stevens Educational Center at 2425 N Street.\nDistrict of Columbia Public Library operates the West End Neighborhood Library."}

The neighborhood covers an area east of the United States Capitol along wide avenues. It is one of the oldest residential communities in Washington. Its two square miles house 35,000 people, so it is one of the most densely populated neighborhoods. The phrase \"Capitol Hill\" can sometime mean the United States Congress instead of the neighborhood.\nCapitol Hill is also a hill as well as a neighborhood. The hill rises in the center of the District of Columbia and extends eastward. Pierre L'Enfant, as he began to develop his plan for the new Federal City in 1791, chose to locate the \"Congress House\" on the crest of the hill, facing the city, a site that L'Enfant characterized as a \"pedestal waiting for a monument.\"\nA large portion of the neighborhood is now designated as the Capitol Hill historic district. The name \"Capitol Hill\" is often used to refer to both the historic district and to the larger neighborhood around it. To the east of Capitol Hill lies the Anacostia River, to the north is the H Street corridor, to the south are the Southeast/Southwest Freeway and the Washington Navy Yard, and to the west are the National Mall and the city's central business district.\nHistory.\nL'Enfant referred to the hill chosen as the site of the future Congress House as \"Jenkins Hill\" or \"Jenkins Heights.\" However, the tract of land had for many years belonged to the Carroll family and was noted in their records of ownership as \"New Troy.\" Some people have said that a man named Jenkins had once pastured some livestock at the site of the Capitol (and thus his name was associated with the site), artist John Trumbull, who would paint several murals inside the Capitol's rotunda, reported in 1791 that the site was covered with a thick wood, making it an unlikely place for livestock to graze. Noone knows who Jenkins was and how his name became associated with the hill, as reported by L'Enfant.\nThe neighborhood that is now called Capitol Hill started to develop when the government began work at two locations, the Capitol and the Washington Navy Yard. It became a distinct community between 1799 and 1810 as the federal government became a major employer. The first stage in its early history was that of a boarding house community developed for members of Congress. In the early years of the Republic, few Congressmen wished to establish permanent residence in the city. Instead, most preferred to live in boarding houses within walking distance of the Capitol.\nIn 1799 the Washington Navy Yard was established on the banks of the Anacostia River, and provided jobs to craftsmen who built and repaired ships. Many of the craftsmen who were employed both at the Navy Yard and in the construction of the Capitol chose to live within walking distance, to the east of the Capitol and the north of the Navy Yard. They became the original residential population of the neighborhood. In 1806, President Thomas Jefferson selected the location of the Marine Barracks, which had to be within marching distance of both the Capitol and the White House, not far from the Washington Navy Yard. By 1810, shops, goldsmiths, blacksmiths, and churches were flourishing in the area.\nThe Civil War resulted in more building in the Capitol Hill area, including new hospitals. Building new houses continued in the 1870s and 1880s. The neighborhood began to divide along racial and economic class lines.\nElectricity, piped water, and plumbing were introduced in the 1890s, and were first available in the downtown areas of the District of Columbia, including Capitol Hill. There was a real estate development boom between 1890 and 1910 as the Capitol Hill area became one of the first neighborhoods having these modern conveniences.\nIn 1976, the National Park Service added the Capitol Hill Historic District to the National Register of Historic Places. It is one of the largest historic districts in the United States. The boundaries of the historic district are irregular, extending southward from F Street NE, as far east as 14th Street, as far west as South Capitol Street, and with a southern limit marked chiefly by Virginia Avenue but including some territory as far south as M Street SE. It includes buildings from the Federal period (1800 to 1820) through 1919, but most of the buildings are late Victorian.\nCapitol Hill has remained a fairly stable middle-class neighborhood throughout its existence. It suffered a period of economic decline and rising crime in the mid-20th century but gradually recovered. During the so-called \"Crack Epidemic\" of the 1980s, its fringes were often affected. More recently, the neighborhood has undergone intense gentrification.\nDescription.\nCapitol Hill's landmarks include not only the United States Capitol, but also the Senate and House office buildings, the Supreme Court building, the Library of Congress, the Marine Barracks, the Washington Navy Yard, and Congressional Cemetery.\nIt is, however, largely a residential neighborhood composed predominantly of rowhouses of different stylistic varieties and periods. Side by side exist early 19th century manor houses, Federal townhouses, small frame dwellings, ornate Italianate bracketed houses and the late 19th century press brick rowhouses with their often whimsical decorative elements combining Richardsonian Romanesque, Queen Anne, and Eastlakian motifs.\nThe main shopping corridor of Capitol Hill is Pennsylvania Avenue. It has shops, restaurants and bars. Eastern Market is an 1873 public market on 7th Street SE, where vendors sell fresh meat and produce in indoor stalls and at outdoor farmers' stands. It is also the site of an outdoor flea market every weekend. After a major fire gutted the main market building on April 30, 2007, it underwent restoration and reopened on June 26, 2009. \nBarracks Row (8th Street SE), so called because of its proximity to the U.S. Marine Barracks, is one of the city's oldest commercial corridors. It dates to the late 18th century and has recently been revitalized.\nMore recently, the Old Naval Hospital has been converted into Hill Center, a new community center. It is at the corner of 9th and Pennsylvania Avenue SE. The rehabilitation of the Old Naval Hospital combines the restoration of a historically significant landmark with the cutting edge technologies of modern \u201cgreen\u201d architecture. Hill Center is a vibrant new home for cultural, educational and civic life on Capitol Hill.\nRecent estimates in Capitol Hill newspapers suggest as many as a third of all Members of Congress live on Capitol Hill while in Washington.\nFamous people who were born in the Capitol Hill neighborhood include John Philip Sousa (whose birthplace, on G St., is still standing) and J. Edgar Hoover. Frederick Douglass's former house can be found in the 300 block of A Street Northeast. (In the 1970s the Douglass house was later used as an African Art Museum by Warren M. Robbins). \nCapitol Hill has several local community newspapers, such as the \"Hill Rag\". The \"Voice of the Hill\" closed in May 2010."}

It is the oldest shore base of the U.S. Navy. The Yard currently serves as a ceremonial and administrative center for the U.S. Navy. It has the offices of the Chief of Naval Operations, the Naval Sea Systems Command, Naval Historical Center, the Department of Naval History, the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, the U.S. Navy Judge Advocate General's Corps, Naval Reactors, Marine Corps Institute, the United States Navy Band, and numerous other naval commands. Before 2006, it used to be the headquarters to the Marine Corps Historical Center, but that center moved to Quantico. The Washington Navy Yard was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. It was designated a National Historic Landmark on May 11, 1976.\nHistory.\nThe history of the yard can be divided into its military history and cultural and scientific history.\nMilitary.\nThe land was purchased under an Act of Congress on July 23, 1799. The Washington Navy Yard was established on October 2, 1799, the date the property was transferred to the Navy. It is the oldest shore base of the U.S. Navy. The Yard was built under the direction of Benjamin Stoddert, the first Secretary of the Navy, under the supervision of the Yard's first commandant, Commodore Thomas Tingey, who served in that capacity for 29 years.\nThe original boundaries that were established in 1800, along 9th and M Street Southeast, are still marked by a white brick wall that surrounds the Yard on the north and east sides. The next year, two additional lots were purchased. The north wall of the Yard was built in 1809 along with a guardhouse, now known as the Latrobe Gate. After the Burning of Washington in 1814, Tingey recommended that the height of the eastern wall be increased to ten feet (3\u00a0m) because of the fire and subsequent looting.\nThe southern boundary of the Yard was formed by the Anacostia River (then called the \"Eastern Branch\" of the Potomac River). The west side was undeveloped marsh. The land located along the Anacostia was added to by landfill over the years as it became necessary to increase the size of the Yard.\nFrom its first years, the Washington Navy Yard became the navy's largest shipbuilding and shipfitting facility, with 22\u00a0vessels constructed there, ranging from small 70-foot (21\u00a0m) gunboats to the 246-foot (75\u00a0m) steam frigate USS \"Minnesota\". The USS \"Constitution\" came to the Yard in 1812 to refit and prepare for combat action.\nDuring the War of 1812, the Navy Yard was an important support facility. It was also helped defend the capital city from the British. Sailors at the Navy Yard were part of the hastily assembled American army which, at Bladensburg, Maryland, opposed the British forces marching on Washington. The Navy Yard sailors and marines of nearby Marine Barracks, Washington, D.C., were in the third and last line of defense at Bladensburg. Together, they fought hand to hand with cutlasses and pikes against the British regulars before being overwhelmed. As the British marched into Washington, holding the Yard became impossible. Tingey, seeing the smoke from the burning Capitol, ordered the Yard burned to prevent its capture by the enemy. Tingey's own quarters (now Quarters\u00a0A) and the Latrobe Gate were spared from the flames. Both structures are now individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\nFollowing the War of 1812, the Washington Navy Yard never regained its prominence as a shipbuilding facility. The waters of the Anacostia River were too shallow to accommodate larger vessels, and the Yard was deemed too inaccessible to the open sea. Thus came a shift to what was to be the character of the Yard for more than a century: ordnance and technology. The Yard possessed one of the earliest steam engines in the United States, and was used to manufacture anchors, chain, and steam engines for vessels of war.\nDuring the American Civil War, the Yard once again became an integral part of the defense of Washington. Commandant Franklin Buchanan resigned his commission to join the Confederacy, leaving the Yard to Commander John A. Dahlgren. President Abraham Lincoln, who held Dahlgren in the highest esteem, was a frequent visitor. The famous ironclad USS \"Monitor\" was repaired at the Yard after her historic battle with the CSS \"Virginia\". The Lincoln assassination conspirators were brought to the Yard following their capture. The body of John Wilkes Booth was examined and identified on the monitor USS \"Montauk\", moored at the Yard.\nFollowing the war, the Yard continued to be the scene of technological advances. In 1886, the Yard was designated the manufacturing center for all ordnance in the Navy. Commander Theodore F. Jewell was Superintendent of the Naval Gun Factory from January 1893 to February 1896. Ordnance production continued as the Yard manufactured armament for the Great White Fleet and the World War I navy. The naval railway guns used in France during World War I were manufactured at the Yard.\nBy World War II, the Yard was the largest naval ordnance plant in the world. The weapons designed and built there were used in every war in which the United States fought until the 1960s. At its peak, the Yard consisted of 188\u00a0buildngs on 126\u00a0acres (0.5\u00a0km\u00b2) of land and employed nearly 25,000 people. Small components for optical systems, and enormous battleship guns were all manufactured here. In December 1945, the Yard was renamed the U.S. Naval Gun Factory. Ordnance work continued for some years after World War II until finally phased out in 1961. Three years later, on July 1, 1964, the activity was redesignated the Washington Navy Yard. The deserted factory buildings began to be converted to office use.\nThe Washington Navy Yard was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973, and designated a National Historic Landmark on May 11, 1976.\nIt was headquarters to the Marine Corps Historical Center. That was moved in 2006 to Quantico.\nCultural and scientific.\nMany scientific developments took place at the Washington Navy Yard. Robert Fulton worked on his clockwork torpedo during the War of 1812. In 1822, Commodore John Rodgers built the country's first marine railway for the overhaul of large vessels. John A. Dahlgren developed his bottle-shaped cannon that became the mainstay of naval ordnance before the Civil War. In 1898, David W. Taylor developed a ship model testing basin which was used by the Navy and private shipbuilders to test the effect of water on new hull designs. The first shipboard aircraft catapult was tested in the Anacostia River in 1912. A wind tunnel was completed at the Yard in 1916. The giant gears for the Panama Canal locks were cast at the Yard. Navy Yard technicians applied their efforts to medical designs for prosthetic hands and molds for artificial eyes and teeth.\nThe Washington Navy Yard was the ceremonial gateway to the nation's capital. In 1860, the first Japanese diplomatic mission was welcomed to the United States in an impressive pageant at the Yard. The body of World War I's Unknown Soldier was received here. Charles A. Lindbergh returned to the Navy Yard in 1927 after his famous transatlantic flight. In 1939, Britain's King George VI, representing the dominion of Canada, visited the Yard during his Washington stay.\nAs of 2004, the Navy Yard houses a variety of activities. It is the main office of the Naval District Washington, and houses numerous support activities for the fleet and aviation communities. The Navy Museum welcomes visitors to the Navy Art Collection. Its displays of naval art and artifacts trace the Navy's history from the Revolutionary War to the present day. The Naval History and Heritage Command is housed in a complex of buildings known as the Dudley Knox Center for Naval History. Leutze Park is the scene of colorful ceremonies.\nThe destroyer USS \"Barry\" is a museum ship at the Washington Navy Yard, and is open to tourists. The \"Barry\" is frequently used for change of command ceremonies for naval commands in the area.\nOperations.\nThe Yard serves as a ceremonial and administrative center for the U.S. Navy, home to the Chief of Naval Operations. It is headquarters for the Naval Sea Systems Command, Naval Historical Center, the Department of Naval History, the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, the U.S. Navy Judge Advocate General's Corps, Naval Reactors, Marine Corps Institute, the United States Navy Band, and many other naval commands.\n2013 shooting.\nOn September 16, 2013, a shooting took place at the Yard. Shots were fired at the headquarters for the Naval Sea Systems Command Headquarters building #197. At least 17 people, including at least eight civilians, one D.C. police officer and one peacekeeper, were shot. Thirteen fatalities were confirmed by the United States Navy and D.C. Police. Officials said the gunman, Aaron Alexis, a 34-year-old civilian contractor from Queens, New York, was killed during a gun battle with police."}

In 1970, he was made a Hero of Socialist Labor. In 1936, he became a member of the CPSU. He became a celebrity in 1935 as part of a movement that was intended to increase worker productivity and demonstrate the superiority of the socialist economic system.\nStakhanov was born in Lugovaya near Oryol. In 1927, he began working in a mine called \"Tsentralnaya-Irmino\" in Kadievka (Donbass). In 1933, Stakhanov became a jackhammer operator. In 1935, he took a local course in mining. On 31 August 1935, it was reported that he had mined a record 102 tonnes of coal in 5\u00a0hours and 45\u00a0minutes (14 times his quota). On 19 September, Stakhanov was reported to have set a new record by mining 227 tonnes of coal in a single shift. His example was held up in newspapers and posters as a model for others to follow, and he even appeared on the cover of Time Magazine.\nBetween 1936 and 1941, Stakhanov was a student of the Industrial Academy in Moscow. In 1941\u20131942, he was appointed director of mine No.\u00a031 in Karaganda. Between 1943 and 1957, Stakhanov worked in the Ministry of Coal Industry of the USSR. In 1957\u20131959, he was deputy director of the \"Chistyakovantratsit\" trust, and after that, assistant chief engineer at the mine management office No.\u00a02/43 of the \"Torezantratsit\" trust until his retirement in 1974.\nStakhanov was a deputy of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR of the first convocation. He was awarded two Orders of Lenin, Order of the Red Banner, and numerous medals. The last Sunday of August was designated \"Coal Miner's Day\", also apparently in his honor.\nThe town of Kadievka in eastern Ukraine where he started his work was renamed Stakhanov in his honour in 1978, after his death.\nStakhanov's records set an example throughout the country and gave birth to the Stakhanovite movement where workers who exceeded production targets could become \"Stakhanovites\". Orwell in Animal Farm presents Boxer as a symbolic character of the \"Stakhanovites\".\nRecord disputed.\nThe validity of Stakhanov's record has since been called into question. In 1985, \"The New York Times\" printed a story that said Stakhanov had indeed succeeded in his feat, but that it was only because the Communist Party had pre-arranged the event. With it, the Communist party wanted to boost public morale. According to this article, many other miners helped Stakhanov beat the mining record. The \"Times\" quoted the chief of the Tsentralnaya-Irmino mine's branch of the Party, Konstantin G. Petrov: \"I suppose Stakhanov need not have been the first... It could have been anybody else. In the final analysis it was not the individual face-worker who determined whether the attempt to break the record would succeed, but the new system of coal extraction.\" In 1988, Soviet newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda claimed that the widely propagandized personal achievements of Stakhanov were puffery \u2013 the paper insisted that Stakhanov had used a number of helpers on support works, while the throughput was tallied for him alone. Still, according to the newspaper, Stakhanov's approach had eventually led to the increased productivity by means of a better organization of the work, including specialization and task sequencing.\nIt has also been claimed that his record was beaten by Alija Sirotanovi\u0107 of Yugoslavia and Sergej Scemuk of Ukraine."}

It is regarded as the first real 'Hellenistic' country also speaking Greek.\nOverview.\nThe Bosporan Kingdom was the longest surviving known Roman client kingdom (allied state). It was a Roman Province between 63 and 68, under Roman Emperor Nero. In the 1st century and 2nd century AD was a period of a new 'golden age' of the Bosporan Kingdom when it was famous for its jewellery. In the end of the 2nd century the King Sauromates II inflicted a critical defeat to the Scythians (a nomadic tribe) and included all the territories of the Crimea in the structure of his state.\nThe Bosporan Kingdom became rich from selling wheat, fish and slaves to rest of Europe. This means that there are a lot of amazing and very rich finds from the Kingdom, especially found in burial barrows (known as kurgans). Today, there are lots of architectural and sculptural remains from the Bosporan Kingdoms and many finds can be seen in the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg, Russia. These include gold work and vases imported from Ancient Athens and the rest of Ancient Greece.\nIt was finally destroyed by the Goths (barbarian tribes) at the end of the 4th century AD"}

Navy Yard is bounded by Interstate 395 to the north, South Capitol Street to the west, and the Anacostia River to the south and east. The neighborhood is named after the Washington Navy Yard. The Navy Yard fills about half of the neighborhood. The neighborhood is in D.C.'s Ward 6, currently represented by Tommy Wells. It is served by the Navy Yard Metro station on the Green Line.\nHistory.\nHistorically, the Anacostia River was once a deep water channel with natural resources and home to the Nacotchtank Indians. In 1791, Pierre Charles L\u2019Enfant designed the plan for Washington D.C. and, recognizing the worth of the Anacostia River, set up the city\u2019s new commercial center and wharfs there. In 1799, the Washington Navy Yard was built in the area and for many decades was the nation\u2019s largest naval shipbuilding facility. Today, the Washington Navy Yard has been run by the Navy longer than anywhere else. \nThe Navy Yard was a busy center in the 19th century and was important in the development of the area. The lively wharf was a center for jobs, serving ships with lumber and raw materials for the growing city. It also played a key role in defending the city from the British during the War of 1812. Surrounding the wharfs was a large commercial district, light industrial businesses, and one of the city\u2019s most notable neighborhoods. As the city and nation developed, the Navy Yard changed from ship building to making finished ship products and weapons ammunition. By the mid-1940s in wartime the Navy Yard and the expanded Annex area were making the most ammo with 26,000 employees in 132 buildings on of land.\nHowever, during the 20th century the river got worse. The pollution of the river made it less valuable to the city. After World War II, the Navy Yard moved everything to a smaller campus, slowing commerce in the area. For this and other reasons the riverfront neighborhoods became overrun with crime.\nRedevelopment.\nFor many years, the neighborhood was an industrial district The area was formerly home to a large commercial and adult-entertainment district, which has now been displaced. Since 1990, the building of a new U.S. Department of Transportation office complex and Nationals Park, the new USD$600 million stadium of the Washington Nationals Major League Baseball team, caused quick changes in the neighborhood. Most of the neighborhood's land and businesses have been purchased by companies and is currently being developed into commercial and residential projects. The area plans to contain 12 to of office space, 9,000 residential units, 1,200 hospitality rooms, of retail space, four public parks, and an Anacostia Riverwalk trail system."}
{"id": "302318", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=302318", "title": "Getty Center", "text": "The Getty Center, located in Brentwood, Los Angeles, California, is a campus founded by oilman J. Paul Getty. It is used for for cultural exhibitions. \nThe center which costed $1.3 billion to built opened on December 16, 1997. \nPeople like its architecture, gardens, and views overlooking the Los Angeles. It is located at the top of a hill. Entrances to the building include traveling from a visitor's parking garage at the bottom of the hill. Alternatively, it also has a three-car cable-pulled tram. \nVisitors.\nThe center draws 1.3 million visitors annually.\nIt is one of two locations of the J. Paul Getty Museum. It has \"pre-20th-century European paintings, drawings, illuminated manuscripts, sculpture, and decorative arts; and 19th- and 20th-century American and European photographs\". \nExhibits.\nOne of the paintings on display is \"Irises\" by Vincent van Gogh. Besides the museum, the center's buildings house the Getty Research Institute (GRI), the Getty Conservation Institute, the Getty Foundation, and the administrative offices of the J. Paul Getty Trust. The latter owns and operates the center. \nIt also has outdoor sculptures displayed on terraces and in gardens. The center was designed by architect Richard Meier. The campus includes a central garden designed by artist Robert Irwin. \nGRI's separate building contains a research library with over 900,000 volumes and two million photographs of art and architecture. The center's design included special provisions to address concerns regarding earthquakes and fires.\nLocation and history.\nThe Getty Museum started in J. Paul Getty's house in Pacific Palisades in 1954. He made the house larger by adding a new section. In the 1970s, Getty built a copy of an Italian villa near his home. \nThis new building was a better place to keep his art collection. It opened as a museum in 1974. After Getty died in 1976, all of the land and buildings were given to the Getty Trust to be used as museum space. However, the collection grew too big for the site. The people running the museum looked for a new location closer to Los Angeles. \nIn 1983, the Trust bought the land where the center is now. The new campus has on a site in the Santa Monica Mountains above Interstate 405, surrounded by kept in a natural state. The land cost $25 million. The top of the hill is above I-405. So, on a clear day it is possible to see not only the Los Angeles skyline but also the San Bernardino Mountains to the east as well as the Pacific Ocean to the west.\nConstruction.\nIn 1984, Richard Meier was chosen to be the architect of the center. It took a several years to get permits to build the Getty Center. The Hathaway Dinwiddie Construction Company built the new buildings starting in August 1989. \nThe construction was significantly delayed, with the planned completion date moved from 1988 to 1995 (as of 1990). By 1995, however, the campus was described as only \"more than halfway complete\".\nThe center finally opened to the public on December 16, 1997. Although the total project cost was estimated to be $350 million as of 1990, it was later estimated to be $1.3 billion. After the center opened, the villa closed for extensive renovations and reopened on January 28, 2006, to focus on the arts and cultures of ancient Greece, Rome, and Etruria. Currently, the museum displays collections at both the Getty Center and the site (called the Getty Villa) in Pacific Palisades.\nIn 2005, the \"Los Angeles Times\" printed a series of articles about how the Getty Trust and its president Dr. Barry Munitz were spending money. However, the California Attorney General investigated of the Getty Trust and found that no laws had been broken. The trust agreed to appoint a person from outside the Trust to review how money would be spent in the future. The Getty Trust experienced financial difficulties in 2008 and 2009 and cut 205 of 1,487 budgeted staff positions to reduce expenses. Although the Getty Trust endowment reached $6.4 billion in 2007, it dropped to $4.5 billion in 2009.\nArchitecture.\nMeier has exploited the two naturally-occurring ridges (which diverge at a 22.5 degree angle) by overlaying two grids along these axes. These grids serve to define the space of the campus while dividing the import of the buildings on it. Along one axis lie the galleries and along the other axis lie the administrative buildings. Meier emphasized the two competing grids by constructing strong view lines through the campus. The main north-south axis starts with the helipad, then includes a narrow walkway between the auditorium and north buildings. \nThe axis continues past the elevator kiosk to the tram station. The axis goes through the rotunda, past the walls and support columns of the exhibitions pavilion, and finally the ramp besides the west pavilion and the central garden. Its corresponding east-west visual axis starts with the edge of the scholar's wing of the Getty Research Institute (GRI), the walkway between the central garden and the GRI, and the overlook to the azalea pool in the central garden. The east-west axis then follows the walkway between the central garden and the west pavilion, and finally the north wall of the west pavilion and the courtyard between the south and east pavilions.\nThe main axes of the museum grid that is offset by 22.5 degrees begins with the arrival plaza, carries through the edge of the stairs up to the main entrance, aligns with the columns supporting the rotunda as well as the center point of the rotunda, aligns with travertine benches in the courtyard between the pavilions, includes a narrow walkway between the west and south pavilions, a staircase down to the cactus garden and ends in the garden. The corresponding cross axis starts with the center point of the circle forming the GRI library garden, then passing to the center of the entrance rotunda, and aligning with the south wall of the rotunda building. Although all of the museum is aligned on these alternative axes, portions of the exhibitions pavilion and the east pavilion are aligned on the true north-south axis as a reminder that both grids are present in the campus.\nThe primary grid structure is a square; most wall and floor elements are squares or some derivative thereof. The buildings at the Getty Center are made from concrete and steel with either travertine or aluminium cladding. Around of travertine was used to build the center.\nThroughout the campus, many fountains provide white noise as a background. The initial design has remained intact; however benches and fences have been installed around the plaza fountains to discourage visitors from wading into the pools. Some additional revisions have been made in deference to the Americans with Disabilities Act.\nThe north promontory is anchored by a circular grass area, which serves as a landing place for helicopters (heliport) in case of emergencies, and the south promontory is anchored by a succulent plant and cactus garden. Access roads also circle the complex and go to loading docks and staff parking garages on both the west and east sides of the buildings. The hillside around the complex has been planted with California Live Oak (\"Quercus agrifolia\") trees.\nAt the bottom of the hill, the museum has a seven-story deep underground visitor parking garage with over 1,200 parking spaces. Its roof has an outdoor sculpture garden. An automated three-car, cable-pulled tram takes passengers between the parking garage at the bottom of the hill and the museum at the top of the hill.\nArrival court and central rotunda.\nVisitors typically arrive at a tram station in the arrival plaza between the administrative buildings and the museum entrance. A large set of steps leads to the main doors of the rotunda building. The rotunda building houses information desks, two orientation theatres and museum shops. It also holds a grand staircase that starts a path toward the paintings on the second floor of each art pavilion. The rotunda opens to the south to a terrace that links all five of the museum pavilions. A separate building to the west of the arrival plaza and stairs holds a cafeteria and restaurant. Next to the restaurant is a stone arch, which separates the museum from the GRI. In between the GRI and the restaurant, outdoor stairs go down from the main level to the central garden.\nMuseum.\nThe Getty Center's estimated 1.3 million visitors annually make it one of the most visited museums in the United States. The collection of the J. Paul Getty Museum on display at the Getty Center includes \"pre-20th-century European paintings, drawings, illuminated manuscripts, sculpture, and decorative arts; and 19th- and 20th-century American and European photographs\". The paintings include:\nGetty's photograph collection is on the lower level of the west pavilion. It includes 35,000 individual prints, 1,500 daguerreotypes and other cased objects, 30,000 stereographs and cartes-de-visite, and 475 albums containing almost 40,000 mounted prints.\nThe museum building has a three-level base building that is closed to the public and provides staff workspace and storage areas. Five public, two-story towers on the base are called the North, East, South, West and the Exhibitions Pavilions. The Exhibitions Pavilion acts as the temporary residence for traveling art collections and the Foundation's artwork for which the permanent pavilions have no room. The permanent collection is displayed throughout the other four pavilions chronologically: the north houses the oldest art while the west houses the newest. The first-floor galleries in each pavilion house light-sensitive art, such as illuminated manuscripts, furniture, or photography. Computer-controlled skylights on the second-floor galleries allow paintings to be displayed in natural light. The second floors are connected by a series of glass-enclosed bridges and open terraces. The bridges and terraces both offer views of the surrounding hillsides and central plaza. Sculpture is also on display at various points outside the buildings, including on various terraces and balconies. The lower level (the highest of the floors in the base) includes a public cafeteria, the terrace cafe, and the photography galleries.\nCentral Garden.\nThe Central Garden at the Getty Center is the work of artist Robert Irwin. Planning for the garden began in 1992, construction started in 1996, and the garden was completed in December 1997.\nIrwin was quoted as saying that the Central Garden \"is a sculpture in the form of a garden, which aims to be art.\" Water plays a major role in the garden. A fountain near the restaurant flows toward the garden and appears to fall into a grotto on the north garden wall. The resulting stream then flows down the hillside into the azalea pool. The designers placed rocks and boulders of varying size in the stream bed to vary the sounds from the flowing water. A tree-lined stream descends to a plaza, while the walkway criss-crosses the stream, which continues through the plaza, and goes over a stone waterfall into a round pool. A maze of azaleas floats in the pool, around which is a series of specialty gardens. More than 500 varieties of plant material are used for the Central Garden, but the selection is \"always changing, never twice the same\".\nAfter the original design, an outdoor sculpture garden, called the \"Lower Terrace Garden\" was added in 2007 on the west side of the central garden just below the scholar's wing of the GRI building.\nGetty Research Institute (GRI).\nThe Getty Research Institute (GRI) is \"dedicated to furthering knowledge and advancing understanding of the visual arts.\" Among other holdings, GRI's research library contains over 900,000 volumes of books, periodicals, and auction catalogs; special collections; and two million photographs of art and architecture. GRI's other activities include exhibitions, publications, and a residential scholars program. At the Getty Center, GRI is to the west of the museum. The round building encircles a landscaped garden and is to the west of the central garden. The main entrance of GRI is connected by a terrace to the main arrival court of the museum, with outdoor sculptures placed along the route. GRI has one art gallery on its entrance level that is open to the public.\nOther offices.\nMeier also designed three other buildings next to the north promontory and offset at a 22.5 degree angle from the main axis of the museum pavilions. The north-most building is an auditorium. Next to it is the North Building, with the East Building sitting between the North Building and the rotunda. The main entrance to the East Building is flanked by two round silos that hold its elevators. A bridge over a sunken courtyard links the main entrance of the East Building to the main walkway that connects the auditorium and North Buildings to the rotunda. These buildings house the Getty Conservation Institute (GCI), the J. Paul Getty Trust and the Getty Foundation. These buildings are generally closed to the public except for special events held in the auditorium. They are linked to the museum both by landscaped terraces and by an enclosed glass walkway that leads from the main rotunda of the museum.\nGCI, which is headquartered at the Getty Center but also has facilities at the Getty Villa, commenced operation in 1985. It \"serves the conservation community through scientific research, education and training, model field projects, and the dissemination of the results of both its own work and the work of others in the field\" and \"adheres to the principles that guide the work of the Getty Trust: service, philanthropy, teaching, and access\". GCI has activities in both art conservation and architectural conservation.\nThe Getty Foundation awards grants for \"the understanding and preservation of the visual arts\". In addition, it runs the Getty Leadership Institute for \"current and future museum leaders\". Its offices are north of the museum. The foundation offices are in the two administrative buildings that are north of the museum. The J. Paul Getty Trust, which oversees the Getty Conservation Institute, Getty Foundation, Getty Research Institute, and J. Paul Getty Museum, also has offices there.\nPreparation for natural disasters.\nEarthquakes.\nAlthough the center's site was thought to have little motion during earthquakes, which are frequent in the Los Angeles area, in 1994, as the center was being constructed, the Northridge earthquake struck. It caused \"disturbing hairline cracks... in the welds and plated joints of the steel framework.\" As a result, the steelwork through the site was retrofitted. The Center's buildings are thought to be able to survive an earthquake of 7.5 magnitude on the Richter scale.\nFires.\nIn the 16 electrical transformers at the center, silicone fluid is used as a coolant \"with less risk of ignition\" than hydrocarbon coolant. The native flammable chaparral was removed and fire-resistant poverty weed was added to the slopes around the center. Each year, a herd of goats is rented to clear brush on the surrounding hills.\nAt the north end of the center, a tank with of water, together with a grass-covered helipad, allow helicopters to collect water. The access ramp from the entry plaza to the museum was constructed to allow a fire truck to pass over it. Inside the museum, the sprinkler system is designed to balance \"between the potential damage of a fire and the risk of water damage to valuable artwork\"."}

Paul Getty Trust has the most money of any art institution in the world. In April 2009, it owns $US\u00a04.2 billion. The Trust's office is in Los Angeles, California. It operates the J. Paul Getty Museum at two locations, the Getty Center in Los Angeles and the Getty Villa in Pacific Palisades district of Los Angeles, California. The Trust's other programs are the Getty Foundation, the Getty Research Institute, and the Getty Conservation Institute.\nThe trust operates one of the most visited museums in the United States and gets 1.3 million visitors per year. The trust also provides grants and training to other museums and cultural institutions. The trust has a library, publications program and visiting scholar program. The trust's conservation program works to improve conservation practice through the creation and delivery of knowledge. However, since 2008, the trust has scaled back the scope of its activities in response to financial challenges.\nHistory.\nJ. Paul Getty started the J. Paul Getty Museum Trust in 1953. Getty had already started the Getty Oil Company, and he was richest Americans in the 1950's. He had more than $2 billion when he died. Getty died in 1976 He left most of his property, including nearly $660 million worth of stock in Getty Oil, to the J. Paul Getty Museum Trust. Legal conflicts over the will took years to resolve, but in 1982 the trust finally received all of the money that Getty. The trust began to add some new programs in 1982. In February 1983, it changed its name to the J. Paul Getty Trust.\nIn 1997, Barry Munitz became the president and CEO of the trust. He began work in January 1998, succeeding Harold M. Williams, the first president of the Getty Trust, who oversaw construction of the $1 billion Getty Center designed by architect Richard Meier. With an endowment of $4.2 billion, the Getty Trust is the wealthiest art institution in the world. Early in his tenure, Munitz reorganized the Getty Trust, closing two of the institution's six programs \u2013 the Getty Information Institute and the Getty Education Institute. To deal with long-run financial issues, he sought to cultivate relationships with donors and corporate partners. His leadership became increasingly controversial as the Getty Trust was embroiled in numerous controversies relating to the provenance of various antiquities in the Getty Museum's collections and Munitz' expense account. In the midst of an investigation by the California Attorney General,\nMunitz resigned in 2006 and was forced to \"forgo his severance package of more than $2 million, and reimburse the Getty Trust for $250,000 after alleged improprieties including lavish expense account spending.\"\nOn December 4, 2006, the trust hired of art historian James N. Wood, the former Director of the Art Institute of Chicago to be the trust's new president and CEO. Wood replaced Barry Munitz, who was forced to step down earlier in the year. In 2009, the trust's assets dropped in value, and Wood cut nearly 100 employees at the trust's various operations, most at the Getty Museum. Fees for parking at the museum and the Getty Villa were raised by 50% to $15. Wood died suddenly of natural causes on June 12, 2010. In May 2011, the trust hired James Cuno, director of the Art Institute of Chicago as president and chief executive of the Getty Trust, to take office in August.\nPrograms.\nThe J. Paul Getty Museum is an art museum. It has two locations, one at the Getty Center in Los Angeles, California, and one at the Getty Villa in Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles, California. The museum at the Getty Center contains \"Western art from the Middle Ages to the present;\" its estimated 1.3 million visitors annually makes it one of the most visited museums in the United States. The museum at the Getty Villa contains art from \"ancient Greece, Rome, and Etruria\". The museum started as J. Paul Getty's personal art collection.\nThe Getty Foundation was originally called the \"Getty Grant Program,\" which began in 1984 under the direction of Deborah Marrow. The J. Paul Getty Trust can spend up to 0.75% of its endowment on gifts and grants; by 1990 the Getty Grant Program (then based in Santa Monica) had made 530 grants totaling $20 million to \"art historians, conservators and art museums in 18 countries\". For example, a foundation grant funded the restoration of the Cosmati Pavement in the floor of Westminster Abbey. For many years, the foundation conducted the Getty Leadership Institute (GLI). The major GLI program is the Museum Leadership Institute (MLI), formerly known as the Museum Management Institute, which \"has served close to 1,000 museum professionals from the United States and 30 countries worldwide\". However, effective on January 2, 2010, the GLI was transferred to the Claremont Graduate University in Claremont, California and was renamed \"The Getty Leadership Institute at Claremont Graduate University\".\nThe Getty Research Institute (GRI), located at the Getty Center in Los Angeles, California, is \"dedicated to furthering knowledge and advancing understanding of the visual arts\". GRI maintains a research library, organizes exhibitions and other events, sponsors a residential scholars program, publishes books, and maintains electronic databases including a Semantic Web service. The GRI was originally called the \"Getty Center for the History of Art and the Humanities\", and was conceived as early as 1983. Among other holdings, GRI's research library contains about 900,000 volumes of books, periodicals, and auction catalogs; special collections; and two million photographs of art and architecture. The library also includes the trust's \"Institutional Archives\" which document the activities of the trust's various programs.\nThe Getty Conservation Institute (GCI) is headquartered at the Getty Center but also has facilities at the Getty Villa, and commenced operation in 1985. The GCI is a private international research institution dedicated to advancing conservation practice through the creation and delivery of knowledge. It \"serves the conservation community through scientific research, education and training, model field projects, and the dissemination of the results of both its own work and the work of others in the field\" and \"adheres to the principles that guide the work of the Getty Trust: service, philanthropy, teaching, and access\". GCI has activities in both art conservation and architectural conservation. GCI scientists study the deterioration of objects and buildings, and how to prevent or stop such deterioration. GCI has also been involved with long-term education programs, such as establishing a Master's degree program in Archaeological and Ethnographic Conservation in collaboration with the University of California, Los Angeles.\nFrom 1983 to June 1999, the Trust ran the Getty Information Institute (GII) which sought to collect electronic information to serve cultural heritage institution and researchers. Together with the American Council of Learned Societies GII sought to build a broad coalition of non-profits to establish a National Initiative for a Networked Cultural Heritage. Upon the dissolution of the GII, its data bases were transferred to the Getty Research Institute.\nGovernance.\nThe Getty Trust Indenture dated December 2, 1953 made a California charitable trust for \"the diffusion of artistic and general knowledge.\" The trust is governed by a 13-member board of trustees. Trustees are elected to serve four-year terms, with a maximum limit of three terms. The board is self-perpetuating with the board electing or re-electing the trustees. The board holds an annual meeting in May or June of each year. Although the board conducts most of its work through committees, a number of important decisions are reserved for the entire board including approval of any art acquisition costing more than $1 million.\nOn October 2, 2006, the California Attorney General issued a report following an investigation of the trust and its operations. At the close of the investigation an independent monitor was hired to assure proper governance and expenditures of the trust. On May 7, 2008, the Attorney General closed the monitoring process.\nThe trust was hurt by the economic downturn following 2007 and has reduced its annual budget by 14%. In 2007, the trust had $6.4 billion in endowment, but this amount dropped to $4.5 billion in 2009. In 2009, the trust had $300 million in expenses down from $349 million in 2008. For example, GRI co-produced the Avery Index to Architectural Periodicals with the Avery Architectural and Fine Arts Library, but transferred that activity to Columbia University on July 1, 2009."}

{"id": "302327", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=302327", "title": "Brentwood (Washington, D.C.)", "text": "Brentwood is a neighborhood in Northeast Washington, D.C.. It is named after the Brentwood Mansion built at Florida Avenue and 6th Street NE in 1817 by Robert Brent, the first mayor of Washington City. He built it as a wedding present for his daughter Eleanor and Congressman Joseph Pearson. Brent gave them both the mansion and a large farm surrounding it. Congressman Pearson also purchased additional properties and expanded the estate further. The property then known as Brentwood was larger than the present (2007) neighborhood known as Brentwood. Images of the mansion may be found in the book \"Capital Losses: A Cultural History of Washington's Destroyed Buildings\" by James W. Goode, and in several books in the collection of the Historical Society of Washington, D.C. Edward Sisson, a descendant of the family that owned the mansion throughout its existence, has posted a collection of paintings, drawings, photos, and histories of the mansion on-line. The Frick Art Reference Library (http://www.frick.org/) has drawings, paintings, and perhaps photographs (although none appear to be accessible on-line as of late 2007). On the web, a small drawing of the mansion, together with a brief description of its owners in 1873, Capt. &amp; Mrs. Carlile Pollock Patterson, may be found in \"Washington Outside and Inside\" by George Alfred Townsend, at page 620, searchable as a \"google book.\"\nMany people think that Benjamin Latrobe (who designed the United States Capitol) designed Brentwood Mansion. However, at the time of the house's design, Latrobe was suffering family troubles and his records for this period are poor.\nDuring the administration of President Ulysses S. Grant (1869-1877), Brentwood Mansion was a center of Washington social life, with many parties hosted by Elizabeth (Eliza) Worthington Patterson (daughter of Joseph Pearson and his third wife Catherine Worthington Pearson) and her husband Carlile Pollock Patterson. Patterson had known Grant since 1852; Patterson's brother-in-law David Dixon Porter, married to Patterson's sister George Ann, was the highest-ranking Admiral in the US Navy; and Patterson's brother Thomas H. Patterson was commander of the Washington Navy Yard (1873-1876) before becoming the Rear Admiral in command of the Asiatic Squadron (1877-1880). Patterson Street, N.E., which is adjacent to the property, was probably named for the Patterson family.\nC.P. Patterson, a Naval officer and ship captain turned scientist and administrator of a government department, had neither the interest nor the aptitude to manage the transformation of a large rural farming and forest property into an urbanized part of the city growing around it. After C.P. Patterson's death in 1881, long-delayed financial problems came to a head, and on June 6, 1884, three years after Patterson's death, Congress enacted a private bill, House bill No. 4689, entitled \"An act for the relief of Eliza W. Patterson,\" C.P. Patterson's widow, excusing accumulated District of Columbia property taxes on the Patterson land. President Chester A. Arthur neither signed nor vetoed the bill, but held it ten days and allowed it to become law without his signature. In a message dated June 21, 1884, the President explained \"I do not question the constitutional right of Congress to pass a law relieving the family of an officer, in view of the services he had rendered his country, from the burdens of taxation, but I submit to Congress that this just gift of the nation to the family of such faithful officer should come from the National Treasury rather than from that of this District, and I therefore recommend that an appropriation be made to reimburse the District for the amount of taxes which would have been due to it had this act not become a law.\"\nAfter five more years confusion, in March 1889, Patterson's son-in-law, Lt. Francis Winslow (II) USN (oldest brother of future Rear Admiral Cameron Winslow), after 19 years of Naval service during the slow-promotion post-war years, resigned from the Navy to devote himself to subdividing, renting, developing, and selling portions of the property. He was successful. A portion of this property later became the subject of a lawsuit that reached the United States Supreme Court, \"Francis Winslow v. Baltimore &amp; Ohio RR Co.\", 188 U.S. 646 (1903), which includes excerpts of the will by which Mrs. Patterson came into the property on the death of her mother, Catherine Worthington Pearson, in 1868. The suit, which the Patterson/Winslow family won, involved renewal of a lease of some of the land to a railroad. (Winslow (II) also developed an expertise in oysters, having led government surveys in the 1870s, 1880s, and 1890s. A \"google\" search on \"Francis Winslow\" and \"oyster\" returns dozens of \"hits,\" referring to the Francis Winslow who managed the Brentwood property. His work is still cited today (2007) as authoritative and accurate. See: http://www.ocracokepreservation.org/id39.html . Winslow was also a leader of US government survey expeditions in Nicaragua, studying potential routes for a canal to connect the Atlantic and Pacific.).\nThe death of Francis Winslow (II) in 1908, suspected to have been caused by illnesses contracted in the Nicaraguan jungle, led to another period of drift in the management of the property as his four sons pursued other careers. In 1917, 100 years after it was built, the vacant Brentwood Mansion burned, and the land became the site of a World War I Army staging camp, Camp Meigs. Three of Francis Winslow (II)'s sons were officers in World War I, and they may have staged in that camp, on their own family land. In 1919 the partially burnt house was finally demolished. Part of the property became the first lumberyard for the building supply and hardware company Hechinger Co., a store that was prominent in Washington into the 1990s.\nIn the 1920s, Lt. Winslow's son, Francis Winslow (III), ended his career as a mining engineer and took over active management of the Brentwood Patterson/Winslow land. His most notable achievement was the development of the Union Market. For years called the Florida Avenue Market, it still operates after 80 years as the city's principal wholesale food and produce market. Photographs and a detailed history of this development may be found in an April 24, 2007, District of Columbia planning document, the Florida Avenue Market Study, at http://www.anc6a.org/FLaveMarketStudy.pdf .\nIn the early 1940s, the District of Columbia used eminent domain to acquire a large parcel of the Patterson land known as \"square 710\", on which is being built (2007) the new headquarters of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (200 Florida Avenue, N.E.). Illustrations of the ATF headquarters can be found at http://www.loopnet.com/xNet/MainSite/Listing/Profile/ProfileSE.aspx?LID=15025032&amp;linkcode=10850&amp;sourcecode=1lww2t006a00001. The seizure of square 710 led to a suit by Winslow (III) as trustee, asserting that the compensation offered by the District was inadequate. Winslow won the suit and a judgment for a larger sum, whereupon, according to the family, the District informed him that it simply didn't have the money to pay the larger judgment. Regardless of payment or nonpayment, title had vested in the government. At about this time, Winslow was demoralized by the death of his 17-year-old daughter in a 1946 car accident, and was then diagnosed with cancer. He died in 1948.\nHis youngest brother Cameron, an insurance executive in Hartford, CT, stepped in as trustee, but it is unclear whether either Francis or Cameron ever received payment from the government of the court-ordered price of \"square 710.\" If not, there may be the ironic situation of a government law-enforcement agency headquarters located on land for which the government did not comply with the law by paying the lawful price. Cameron Winslow, determining that no one in the next generation appeared interested in managing the property, and unable to manage the properties day-to-day from Hartford, began selling all remaining parts of the property in the 1950s, completing the last of the sales in the 1960s, breaking-up the landed estate that Robert Brent had assembled some 200 years before.\nOver the decades, much of the land was acquired by or donated to Gallaudet University, a prominent school for the deaf. Cogswell Hall, a residence hall of Gallaudet University, is said to be built on the site of the old Brentwood Mansion. According to a website on Washington ghost stories, http://members.aol.com/waniehol/DCplaces.html, students have reported that it is haunted by the spirit of a little girl. Allegedly, blankets have been yanked off, an unplugged alarm clock went off, papers have moved with no draft or breeze, there are feelings of being watched, and at least one student has been tapped awake with no one there.\nBrentwood neighborhood as it is today (whose boundaries are somewhat different than the original Brent property, as increased by Pearson) is trapezoidal in its geography. It is bounded by New York Avenue to the south, Montana Avenue to the east, Rhode Island Avenue NE to the north, and the tracks of the Washington Metro's Red Line and Amtrak's Northeast Corridor to the west. It is serviced by the Rhode Island Ave-Brentwood Metro station. Politically, Brentwood is in Ward 5.\nBrentwood has the main post office for Washington, D.C. It was the postal mail sorting facility through which anthrax-contaminated mail addressed to two members of the U.S. Senate passed in the 2001 anthrax attacks. The Post Office is now named after Joseph Curseen Jr. and Thomas Morris Jr., who were postal workers who died after exposure to the anthrax in the incident. The 633,000 square foot facility was closed October 21, 2001, because of anthrax contamination and did not reopen until December 21, 2003.\nThe area also is the site of a major rapid transit rail maintenance facility of the Washington Metropolitan Area Transportation Authority (WMATA), the principal public transit operator in metropolitan Washington, D.C. It is served by the New York Avenue Metrorail station."}

The town has an area of , and as of October 1, 2004 the population of the area was 19,170. The town was created on October 1, 2005, when the towns of Shizugawa and Utatsu merged to form the new town of Minamisanriku.\nMinamisanriku was largely destroyed by the Japanese 2011 tsunami, with most buildings swept away by waves of or more. Over half the town's population is missing and almost certainly dead.\n2011 earthquake and tsunami disaster.\n95 percent of the town was destroyed by the 2011 Japanese tsunami that followed the 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake. Only the tallest buildings remain and an estimated 9,500 people are missing, roughly half the population. 9,700 people are confirmed alive and evacuated.\nThe town had two evacuation centres where residents could go to escape from a tsunami. One was on the southern headland overlooking the town. The other was inland away from the center of the town. Although both were 20 meters above sea level, the tsunami covered them and washed people away. At least 31 of the town's 80 designated evacuation sites were inundated by the tsunami.\nOne early report suggests that many residents may have evacuated to the nearby city of Tome, Miyagi. According to an English teacher at the local high school located on a hill above the tsunami, \"The entire town was simply swept away. It just no longer exists. There were around 7,000 of us on the hill that day. Perhaps a few thousand at the school on the hill opposite. But there are 17,000 in the town. All the others have gone.\" Since the schools were all on high ground, many children were orphaned. Survivors wrote \"SOS\" in white lettering, in the playing field of Shizugawa High school.\nWhen the earthquake struck, the mayor of the town, Jin Sato (\u4f50\u85e4\u4ec1), was talking at the town assembly. They were discussing the much smaller tsunami caused by the March 9 foreshock before the March 11 earthquake. The three-story building of the town's was covered by the tsunami. Out of the 130 people who worked at the town hall, Sato was one of only 30 who reached the roof. He was one of only 10 who survived. He returned to government affairs, founding the headquarters for disaster control at the Bayside Arena on March 13, 2011.\nShizugawa hospital was one of the few major buildings that survived the tsunami. However, it was partly flooded, and 74 out of 109 patients died. Close to 200 people were rescued from the roof of the building.\nMiki Endo (\u8fdc\u85e4\u672a\u5e0c), a 25 year old employee of the town's Crisis Management Department, continued to broadcast warnings and alerts over a community loudspeaker system as the tsunami came in. People believe she saved many lives. The three-storey headquarters of the department remained standing but only the steel frame remained. All of the interior and walls were destroyed. After the disaster, Endo was missing and was later found dead. Photos show the roof of the building completely submerged at the height of the tsunami. Some people held onto an antenna on the roof.\nInternational response.\nThe town is the site of the first field hospital established by an outside nation offering assistance following the disaster. A team of five doctors from Israel set up a surgery. A 53 member group of medical personnel from the Home Front Command and the IDF\u2019s Medical Corps opened a field hospital near Minamisanriku on March 29. The clinic included surgical, pediatrics and maternity wards, and an intensive care unit, pharmacy and laboratory along with 62 tons of medical supplies.

It is primarily an industrial neighborhood. It is dominated by warehouses and the Ivy City Yard, a railroad coach yard and maintenance facility for Amtrak. The area has undergone some renewal. But Ivy City still remains among the poorest parts of the city.\nGeography.\nIvy City is bounded by New York Avenue to the northwest, West Virginia Avenue to the east, and Mt. Olivet Road to the south. The neighborhood is surrounded on all sides by significant landmarks: Gallaudet University (across Mt. Olivet Rd.), Mt. Olivet Cemetery (across West Virginia Ave.), and Amtrak's Ivy City yard (across New York Ave.).\nPolitically, Ivy City is in Ward 5.\nHistory.\nIn 1831, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&amp;O) received approval of a plan to build its Washington Branch. Passenger train service between Baltimore and Washington began in 1835. As part of the construction, the railroad company built its last roundhouse (the current Amtrak yard) one mile outside the city limit. The railroad then worked with land speculators to develop the tract immediately next to the roundhouse as \"Ivy City\". Ivy City became an early Washington suburb. It housed railroad employees and give a formal mailing address to the roundhouse.\nIvy City became part of the city of Washington with the passage of the Organic Act of 1878, which extended the city to occupy all of the District of Columbia.\nOver the years, railroads were one of the few industries to consistently give jobs to African Americans. Ivy City became an increasingly black section of town. In 1911, while Washington DC had separate schools for black and white students, the neighborhood's first colored school, Alexander Crummell Elementary School, opened in Ivy City. The school quickly became a symbol of civic pride in the neighborhood and a major community anchor.\nThe economic status of Ivy City went up and down with the economic success of the railroads. After World War II, U.S. rail travel suffered terrible declines due to the rise of the commercial airline industry and the Interstate Highway System. In 1963, B&amp;O was bought by the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad; the two were combined in the Chessie System in 1973. Three years after that, the Ivy City yard was acquired by the newly created Amtrak, which leased it to commuter rail services.\nAmtrak gave some stability to the industrial tenor of the neighborhood. But Ivy City had suffered a lot from the railroad industry's decades-long downturn. Even after Amtrak took over the train yard, Washington entered a period of poor city management and economic blight. This was hard on low-income neighborhoods. Those who could afford to leave Ivy City did; its population decreased by a third in the 1990s.\nIvy City remains home to many of the poorest residents of the District. It is largely occupied by old warehouses, abandoned and decrepit homes, and large expanses of parking lots, and crime. By mid-2005, the city's recent trend toward gentrification had only just begun to reach some parts of Ivy City. Only 20 percent of Ivy City residents own their own homes. In 2011, Habitat for Humanity built or rennovated 23 houses in Ivy City.\nGovernment and infrastructure.\nAmtrak maintains some offices in Ivy City."}

It is based in Los Angeles, California, at the Getty Center. In the past, it funded the Getty Leadership Institute for \"current and future museum leaders\", which is now at Claremont Graduate University. Its budget for 2006-07 was budget of $27.8 million. It is part of the J. Paul Getty Trust.\nGrants.\nThe Foundation was originally called the \"Getty Grant Program.\" That program began in 1984 under the direction of Deborah Marrow. The J. Paul Getty Trust can spend up to 0.75% of its endowment on gifts and grants; by 1990 the Getty Grant Program (then based in Santa Monica) had made 530 grants totaling $20 million to \"art historians, conservators and art museums in 18 countries\". Among notable grants of the Program were grants to partially fund the publication of books, for example to \"provide for additional illustrations or allow a book's purchase price to be lowered\". Some books \"published with the assistance of the Getty Grant Program\" were:\nIn 1998, the Program granted $750,000 for electronic cataloging to art museums in the Los Angeles area. The program awarded $180,000 in 1999 to the National Gallery in Prague to digitize images of works of art in its collections. In 2005, the program awarded the University of California, Los Angeles and to the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston almost $400,000 to \"support the documentation and preservation of Latino and Latin American art\".\nThe name of the Getty Grant Program was changed to \"Getty Foundation\" in 2005 to \"better reflect[] the expanded scope of the Getty's grant-making over the past two decades and reaffirm[] its commitment to philanthropy going forward\". Grants made by the Foundation include funding the Multicultural Undergraduate Internship Program, begun in 1993, \"seeks to increase staff diversity within visual arts organizations\" in Los Angeles County. Between 2002 and 2007, the Foundation expended over $13.5 million to fund \"plans to care for, maintain, and preserve... historic resources\" at 86 United States colleges and universities. In 2006, the Foundation committed $3.5 million to restore an 80 by 100\u00a0foot \"America Tropical\" mural on Olvera Street in Los Angeles that was painted by David Alfaro Siqueiros. In 2006, in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, the Foundation announced a $2 million fund \"to aid New Orleans's visual arts organizations\".\nAs of June 2008, the Foundation has four priorities for grants:\nIn the summer of 2011, the foundation is funding Multicultural Undergraduate Internships at 70 Los Angeles-area museums and visual arts organizations. The internships seek to attract into museum and visual arts organizations students from historically underrepresented groups: people of African American, Asian, Latino/Hispanic, Native American, and Pacific Islander descent.\nGetty Leadership Institute at Claremont Graduate University.\nThe Foundation also sponsors the Getty Leadership Institute (GLI). The major GLI program is the Museum Leadership Institute (MLI). The MLI was formerly known as the Museum Management Institute. It \"has served close to 1,000 museum professionals from the United States and 30 countries worldwide\". It offers a three-week curriculum for \"museum directors and senior executive team members\", with instruction in areas such as \"strategy, marketing, management and finance\". Most of the attendees work in art museums; among the executives who attended the MLI were the directors of the Frick Collection, San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, Van Gogh Museum, and Winnipeg Art Gallery.\nIn addition to the MLI, GLI offers other professional development programs, convenes meetings involving non-profit agencies, and hosts an online forum. The GLI began in 1979 with a headquarters in New York City and classes taught at the University of California Berkeley. From 1999 to 2009, the program was headquartered at the Getty Center in Los Angeles, California. In 2004, classes moved from Berkeley to the Getty Center. In 2010, the GLI affiliated with Claremont Graduate University in Claremont, California and was renamed The Getty Leadership Institute at Claremont Graduate University. After the transfer, the foundation supports the GLI with a three-year, $2.2 million grant, but the program is headquartered on the Claremont campus. Claremont is paying for GLI's indirect costs. Although the transfer took effect on January 2, 2010, the 2010 MLI was held at the Getty Center. The 2011 MLI will be held on the Claremont campus.\nSenior staff.\nThe Foundation's senior staff includes:\nDeborah Marrow, who was Foundation Director, now serves as interim president and CEO of the J. Paul Getty Trust.\nEmployees and budget.\nDuring the period July 2006 - June 2007, the Foundation had approximately 30 full-time and part-time employees, and a budget of $27.8 million.\nFoundation with similar name.\nThe Getty Foundation should not be confused with the \"Ann and Gordon Getty Foundation,\" which is based in San Francisco, California, and which awards grants largely \"to promote the fields of music, the opera, and the symphony\"."}

Paul Getty Trust. It is headquartered at the Getty Center but also has facilities at the Getty Villa. It commenced operation in 1985. The GCI is a private international research institution dedicated to advancing conservation practice through the creation and delivery of knowledge. It \"serves the conservation community through scientific research, education and training, model field projects, and the dissemination of the results of both its own work and the work of others in the field\" and \"adheres to the principles that guide the work of the Getty Trust: service, philanthropy, teaching, and access.\" GCI works in both art conservation and architectural conservation.\nGCI conducts scientific research related to art conservation. It offers formal education and training programs. GCI published a number of scholarly books. GCI pays for field projects around the world to preserve cultural heritage.\nScientific projects.\nGCI scientists study the decay of objects and buildings, and how to prevent or stop such decay. One of many projects in this area involved the effect of outdoor and indoor air pollutants on museum collections. Another project analyzed the cause of deterioration of the sandstone in the original National Capitol Columns now at the United States National Arboretum.\nIn addition, GCI \"conducts scientific research on materials' composition.\" For example, a project on the conservation of photographs has as one of its objectives the creation of an \"Atlas of Analytical Signatures of Photographic Processes\" which will provide \"a precise chemical fingerprint of all the 150 or so ways pictures have been developed.\" As a part of that project, Getty scientists once examined the world's first photograph from nature by Nic\u00e9phore Ni\u00e9pce. Using X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and other techniques during the 2002-2003 project, they found (for example) that bitumen of Judea was present in the image.\nEducation and training.\nTraining of conservation works is an important part of GCI's work. For example, GCI collaborated with other organizations to create a course \"to assist museum personnel in safeguarding their collections from the effects of natural and human-made emergencies.\" Also, GCI developed a course on the \"Fundamentals of the Conservation of Photographs\" which is now taught in eastern Europe by the Academy of Fine Arts and Design in Bratislava and the Slovak National Library. Besides courses and workshops, GCI has also been involved with long-term education programs, such as establishing a Master's degree program in Archaeological and Ethnographic Conservation in collaboration with the University of California, Los Angeles.\nField projects.\nGCI workers travel to other places to protect items important to history (field projects).\nGCI's field projects are \"selected based on how they fit the institute's goals of raising public awareness, contributing new, broadly applicable information to the field, and supporting cultural heritage\" and \"must be executed in collaboration with partners\u2026 who must be serious about their efforts\u2026 so that projects are assured of continuing after the Getty's involvement ceases.\" Among other completed GCI field projects were efforts to preserve the Mogao Caves and Yungang Grottoes in China (announced in 1989); to restore prehistoric rock paintings of Sierra de San Francisco in Baja California Sur (1994); and to protect ancient buildings and archaeological sites in Iraq following the start of the Iraq war (2004).\nDissemination of information.\nIt has been stated that \"perhaps the institute's most profound contribution to conservation is the dissemination of information and methods learned in the field.\" GCI spreads information in conferences; lectures; books; and online publications, newsletters, video, and audio.\nThe following are selected books published by GCI:\nHere is a selection of courses by GCI:\nSenior staff.\nSince GCI was established, it has had three directors. Besides the director, the GCI senior staff includes:\nIn 2009, GCI had a $33 million budget. This is less than the $41 million budget for 2008.\nGetty conservation activities outside GCI.\nIn addition to the work of the GCI, the J.

It is a program of the J. Paul Getty Trust. GRI maintains a research library, organizes exhibitions and other events, sponsors a residential scholars program, publishes books, and produces electronic databases.\nHistory.\nThe GRI was originally called the \"Getty Center for the History of Art and the Humanities\", and was first discussed in 1983. Located in Santa Monica, its first director (beginning in 1985) was Kurt W. Forster. GRI's library had 30,000 volumes in 1983, but grew to 450,000 volumes by 1986.\nIn a statement upon his departure in 1992, Forster summarized his tenure as \"Beginning with the rudiments of a small museum library... the center grew... to become one of the nation's preeminent research centers for arts and culture...\". In 1994, Salvatore Settis, a professor of the history of classical art and archeology in Italy, became the director of the Center. By 1996, the Center's name had been changed to \"Getty Research Institute for the History of Art and the Humanities\", and by 1999 it was known simply as \"Getty Research Institute\".\nOne GRI's special projects was \"L.A. as Subject: The Transformative Culture of Los Angeles Communities\" conducted between 1995 and 1999, whose purposes included \"enhanc[ing] existing resources and develop new resources that support new research scholarship on LA and also encourag[ing] the preservation, conservation, and display of local material culture\". GRI worked with other local organizations to publish \"Cultural Inheritance/L.A.: A Resource Directory of Less Visible Archives and Collections in the Los Angeles Region\" in 1999. In 2000, the \"L.A. as Subject\" project was transferred to the University of Southern California. That school continues to update and expand an online version of the resource directory.\nThe Getty Information Institute (formerly the Art History Information Program, established in 1983) was dissolved in 1999 as a \"result of a change of leadership at the Getty Trust\". GRI absorbed \"many of its functions\".\nIn 2000, Thomas E. Crow was hired as GRI director to replace Settis who had resigned in 1999. Crow announced in October 2006 that he would be leaving for New York University. Since November 2007 Thomas W. Gaehtgens has been GRI's director; he was previously (1985\u20131986) a visiting scholar with the Getty Center for the History of Art and the Humanities.\nPrograms.\nLibrary.\nAmong other holdings, GRI's research library owns about 900,000 volumes of books, periodicals, and auction catalogs; special collections; and two million photographs of art and architecture. The library is at the Getty Center. It does not loan its items to be taken out of the library. However, any visitor can come to the library to use items there.\nExhibitions and other events.\nGRI holds three public art shows (exhibitions) per year in its gallery which \"focus primarily on the special collections of the Research Library or on work produced by artists in residence\". For example, in 2005\u20132006 GRI held an exhibition entitled \"Julius Shulman, Modernity and the Metropolis\". The exhibition traveled to the National Building Museum and to the Art Institute of Chicago.\nIn addition to exhibitions, GRI has lectures (open to the public), colloquia (most open to the public), workshops (by invitation only), and screenings of films and videos (open to the public).\nResidential scholars program.\nThe GRI hires people who work at other art museums and colleges to work for a year at GRI. After the year is over, the people go back to their old jobs. The goal is to help spread ideas between people who work for different art museums. The residential scholars program seeks to \"integrate the often isolated territory of art history into the wider sphere of the humanities\". The first class of scholars arrived in 1985\u20131986; they had their salaries paid for and their housing provided but were under \"absolutely no obligation to produce\". Among the notable scholars was German writer Christa Wolf in 1993\u20131994, who wrote the novel \"Medea: a modern retelling\" during her year at GRI.\nEach year the scholars are invited to work on projects related to an annual theme. In 2008\u20132009, the theme for the Getty Center was \"Networks and Boundaries\" and for the Getty Villa \"The Power and Function of Ancient Images\". The lengths of stay vary: Getty scholars are in residence for three, six or nine months, visiting scholars for one to three months, and predoctoral and postdoctoral fellows for a nine month academic year. In 2011-12, the theme is \"Artistic Practice\".\nPublications.\nGRI publishes \"Series Imprints\" books in the categories of \"Issues and Debates\", \"Texts &amp; Documents\", \"Introduction To\" (on \"cultural heritage information in electronic form\"), and \"ReSources\" (on the library's special collections). In addition, GRI publishes exhibition catalogs and other materials in hardcopy form.\nThis is a list of some of the books published by GRI, by the Getty Research Institute for the History of Art and the Humanities, by the Getty Center for the History of Art and the Humanities, by the Getty Information Institute, or by the Art History Information Program:\nElectronic databases.\nGRI continues to produce some of the electronic databases from the former Getty Information Institute. They are:\nIn 2006, GRI and the OCLC Online Computer Library Center announced that the Getty Vocabularies (Art &amp; Architecture Thesaurus, Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Names, and Union List of Artist Names) will be available as a Web service.\nUntil July 1, 2009, the Getty Information Institute and later GRI co-produced the Avery Index to Architectural Periodicals with the Avery Architectural and Fine Arts Library. On that date, GRI transferred the database back to Columbia University, which continues to maintain it.\nSenior staff.\nGRI's senior staff includes:\nEmployees and budget.\nDuring the period July 2006 \u2013 June 2007, GRI had approximately 200 full-time and part-time employees. Its budget was $63.7 million."}

Alienation can be talked about in many ways. In psychology, researchers talk about alienation in terms of how well or unwell people fit in to their social groups. This may include how well people relate to their peers in a school or workplace, and how connected they feel to those around them.\nIn sociology, alienation is a more complex and difficult idea. Alienation is how people understand themselves in relation to their entire society. A good example of this is how people think of themselves when they are working and doing a job. Karl Marx wrote about this. This kind of alienation happens when people do work that they are not interested in or find boring. However, in almost all societies some people may have to do jobs that they don't like because they need to earn money. This can be seen as a type of alienation because a person's true feelings and their actions are separated and unrelated. On the other hand, a person might feel empowered and connected if they do a job that they do like. Empowerment and the feeling of being connected is the opposite of alienation.\nAlienation is also a key element in the existentialism of Sartre and Camus. The connection between these ideas is the theme of Colin Wilson's \"The Outsider\" (1956). Anomie is another related idea."}

From 1889 to 1903, Cornell operated the New York State College of Forestry, until the Governor vetoed its annual appropriation. The school was moved to Syracuse University in 1911. It is now the State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry. In 1908, the State legislature began the NY State College of Ceramics at Alfred University.\nIn 1946-48, the Governor appointed a Temporary Commission on the Need for a State University. It was chaired by Owen D. Young, then-Chairman of the General Electric Company. The Commission studied New York's existing higher education institutions and recommended consolidating them into a state university system. While Thomas E. Dewey was Governor, the state legislature established The State University of New York in 1948. The new law followed the commission's recommendations. The system was greatly expanded during the administration of Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller, who took a personal interest in the design and construction of new SUNY facilities across the state.\nOn October 8, 1953, SUNY took a historic step of banning national fraternities and sororities that discriminated based on race or religion from its 33 campuses. Various fraternities challenged this rule in court. As a result, national organizations felt pressured to open their membership to students of all races and religions.\nOrganization.\nSUNY is governed by a Board of Trustees, which consists of sixteen members, fifteen of whom are appointed by the Governor, with consent of the New York State Senate. The sixteenth member is the President of the SUNY Student Assembly. The Board of Trustees appoints the Chancellor who serves as SUNY Chief Executive Officer. The SUNY Chancellor is Nancy L. Zimpher.\nThe state of New York assists in financing the SUNY system, which, along with CUNY, provides lower-cost college-level education to residents of the state. SUNY students also come from out-of-state and 171 foreign countries. Out of state and foreign students pay more tuition than do students from New York State.\nAlthough tuition is higher for these non-resident students, their tuition is subsidized by New York State taxpayer dollars.\nFor the 2010-2011 academic year, tuition costs at SUNY schools for an undergrad degree are less than two-thirds the cost of most other state run college institutions in the U.S. \nTuition at the State University of New York at Buffalo for an undergraduate degree is $7,772.75 per semester or $15,545.50 per year for non-resident students. \nUndergrad tuition for non-resident students at the University of Maryland is $24,830.44 per year. \nNon-resident tuition and fees at University of Oregon are $25,830.00 per year.\nThere are a large variety of colleges in the SUNY system with some overlap in specialties from site to site. SUNY divides its campuses into four distinct categories: university centers/doctoral-granting institutions, university colleges, technology colleges, and community colleges. SUNY also has a unique relationship with its statutory colleges which embeds state-funded colleges within other institutions such as Cornell University and Alfred University. Students at the statutory colleges have the benefit of state-subsidized tuition while receiving all of the campus life amenities of the host institutions.\nSUNY and the City University of New York are entirely different university systems. (However, both are public institutions which receive funding from New York State.) Also, SUNY is not to be confused with the University of the State of New York (USNY), which is the governmental umbrella organization for most education-related institutions and many education-related personnel (both public and private) in New York State, and which includes, as a component, the New York State Education Department.\nStudent representation.\nIn the 1970s, students asked for voting representation on the governing boards of SUNY colleges. In 1971, the State Legislature added five student voting members to Cornell's Board of Trustees. In 1975, the legislature added a non-voting student seat to the boards of all SUNY units. Two Attorney General of the State of New York opinion letters reduced the parliamentary rights of the student members to participate at meetings. These documents indicated that the student members were not in fact Public Officers. For this reason the Attorney General said the students might be taken to court for their decisions. In 1977, another statutory amendment made student members of SUNY councils and boards subject to the NYS Public Officers Law or NYS General Municipal Law and granted student representatives parliamentary powers of moving or seconding motions and of placing items on the agendas of the bodies. Finally, the legislature gave full voting rights to the student members in 1979, resulting in the students of all SUNY units having voting representatives, except for the NYS College of Environmental Science and Forestry. Finally, in 1986, the legislature gave the student representative of that college voting rights as well.\nCampuses.\nInstitute for Community College Development.\nThe Institute for Community College Development (ICCD) operates leadership ability assessment programs. It also provides leadership skills development. ICCD's programs are open to administrators, faculty and trustees of SUNY's community colleges. The ICCD also conducts two \"Successful Teaching Conferences\" each year for developing community college faculty skills. ICCD is a part of the New York State School of Industrial and Labor Relations."}

It is part of the State University of New York (SUNY) system. Upstate's main departments includes the College of Medicine, College of Nursing, College of Health Professions and College of Graduate Studies.\nIt is one of only 140 academic medical centers in the USA and takes care of 1.8 million people yearly. 10,959 people work at Upstate and it creates more than $2.5 billion in impact. Upstate is Central New York's largest employer.\nHistory.\nThe present-day university's earliest predecessor was Geneva Medical College founded 1834 as part of Geneva College, today known as Hobart and William Smith Colleges. The new medical college was located in Geneva, New York, and became the first college to grant a full M.D. to a woman, Elizabeth Blackwell in 1849. In 1871, the college was disbanded and its assets donated to the recently-founded Syracuse University, which subsequently founded a medical college.\nIn 1950, Syracuse University transferred the college to the State University of New York (SUNY). It has been owned by SUNY since then. At first the school was named \"SUNY Upstate Medical Center\" and later named \"SUNY Health Science Center at Syracuse\" in 1986. The current name was adopted in 1999.\nA clinical campus in Binghamton, New York for third and fourth year medical students was established in 1979.\nA plaque in the lobby of Weiskotten Hall aptly describes one of the institution's driving philosophies:\n\"Dedicated to all those of scientific and technological mind who purpose to serve humanity.\"\nCampus.\nThe university's main campus is located in downtown Syracuse, New York flanking Interstate 81. It includes the University Hospital, the Institute for Human Performance, Setnor Academic Building, Central New York Gamma Knife Center, Jacobsen Hall, Regional Oncology Center, Upstate Golisano Children's Hospital, Weiskotten Hall (which includes the Health Sciences Library), and Clark Tower dormitory for 170 students.\nA clinical campus in Binghamton, New York teaches third and fourth year medical students. Some students spend their first two years of medical school in Syracuse, New York and then complete their training in Binghamton. Other students stay in Syracuse for all four years.\nOrganization.\nThe College of Medicine is one of the oldest medical schools in New York. It has the highest percentage of non-white students of any medical school in the state. More physicians practicing in Central New York received their training at Upstate than at any other medical school. Upstate also ranks eighth nationally for the number of graduates who are on the faculty of a academic medical center in the United States.\nThe Colleges of Nursing and Health Related Professions also important to Central New York. The College of Nursing is the only nursing school in New York to offer graduate programs in all major tracks: nurse practitioner, clinical nurse specialist, nurse midwifery, and nurse anesthesia. Approximately three-fourths of its students are minorities.\nThe College of Health Related Professions is the gateway for students seeking to enter some of the most competitive and highly paid careers in healthcare today: physician assistant, physical and occupational therapy, medical informatics, diagnostic medical imaging, and midwifery. The college is particularly proud of its historic claim to having the oldest midwifery program in the nation.\nThe School of Graduate Studies is known for its excellence in basic science education and research. Students have the opportunity to work side by side with many of the top neuroscientists and basic researchers in the country.\nThe university operates the Southern Tier Center on Aging in conjunction with the SUNY Binghamton. The Center develops, implements and evaluates new interventions and models of service delivery geared to enhancing quality of life of older adults and their caregivers.\nThe current president is Mantosh Dewan, MD."}

It is often called just Magny-Cours. It is most well known for hosting the Formula One French Grand Prix, which was held there between 1991 and 2008.\nHistory.\nThe circuit was built in 1960 by Jean Bernigaud. It was the home to the L'\u00e9cole de pilotage Winfield racing school. The school provided such drivers as Fran\u00e7ois Cevert and Jacques Laffite. In the 1980s, the track condition was not very good. It needed a lot of repairs. The circuit was not used for international racing until it was purchased by the Regional Conseil de la Ni\u00e8vre.\nIn the 1990s the Ligier (later known as Prost) Formula One team was based at the circuit. They did a lot of their testing at Magny-Cours. It started hosting the F1 French Grand Prix in 1991, and the Bol d'Or motorcycle race in 2000. The circuit was re-designed in 2003 and used for a wide range of events include various sports and commercial use.\nThe circuit does not provide many overtaking opportunities. The races here are commonly regarded as quite uneventful.\nFor the 2003 event, the final corner and chicane were changed in an effort to increase overtaking. It did not help much. The change did make the pitlane much shorter. Because less time was lost making a pit stop, Michael Schumacher was able to win the 2004 French Grand Prix using a four-stop strategy.\nIn 2006, the circuit was the scene of more Formula One history. Michael Schumacher became the first driver to win a single Grand Prix 8 times at the same circuit.\nThe 2007 race was to mark the last French Grand Prix at Magny-Cours. The French Grand Prix had been indefinitely suspended from the Formula One calendar. Bernie Ecclestone originally said that F1 would not return to Magny-Cours in 2008. He wanted to move to another location, possibly in Paris. \nWhen the official calendar on July 2007, the 2008 French Grand Prix was still in place at Magny-Cours.\nIn May 2008, Ecclestone confirmed that Magny-Cours would stop hosting the French Grand Prix after the 2008 race. He suggested he was looking into hosting the French Grand Prix on the streets of Paris.\nIn June 2008, the provisional calendar for the 2009 season was released. The French Grand Prix at Magny-Cours appeared on it, scheduled for 28 June. However, in October 2008 the 2009 French Grand Prix was canceled after the French Motorsports Federation (FFSA) withdrew financing for the event.\nIn 2009 the track hosted its first Superleague Formula event. It has also been confirmed it will host a second event in 2010.\nThe circuit.\nThe current track is a modern, smooth circuit. It has good facilities for the teams and spectators. It is from Paris in central France. Many corners are modeled on famous turns from other circuits, and are named after those circuits. Examples include the fast Estoril corner and the Adelaide hairpin. It has a mix of slow hairpins and high-speed chicane sections. It includes a long fast straight into the first-gear Adelaide hairpin, the best overtaking opportunity on the circuit. The circuit is very flat with little change in elevation. It does not provide many overtaking opportunities, despite modifications in 2003. "}

He is also an educator, composer, skilled public speaker, and philosopher. He was born on 14 January 1950. His birth name was Giridhar Mishra (IAST: Giridhara Mi\u015bra). He can speak 22 languages. He lives in Chitrakuta, Uttar Pradesh, India.\nIn 1988 he became one of the four \"Jagadguru Ramanandacharyas\", the leaders of the Ramananda order. He is the founder of Tulsi Peeth which is a religious and social service organization. It is in Chitrakuta. It is named after the saint Tulsidas. He is the founder and lifelong chancellor of the Jagadguru Rambhadracharya Handicapped University. It is a university in Chitrakuta and it gives graduate and postgraduate courses entirely to the four types of disabled students, having a poor physical or mental ability. Jagadguru Rambhadracharya became blind at the age of two months. He has never used Braille or any other help to learn or compose. He can speak 22\u00a0languages, and he is a self-produced poet (\"Ashukavi\"). He is a composer in Sanskrit, Hindi, Avadhi, Maithili and many other languages. He has written more than 80 books, which include four story telling poems (two in Sanskrit and two in Hindi), a Hindi series of comments on the Ramcharitmanas, a Sanskrit series of comments on the Ashtadhyayi, and a Sanskrit series of comments on the \"Prasthanatrayi\" religious books (the Brahma Sutra, the Bhagavad Gita and the main Upanishads). He is seen as one of the greatest sources of information on Tulsidas in India, and he is the editor of a critical edition of the Ramcharitmanas. He is a famous Katha artist for the Ramayana and the Bhagavata. His Katha programmes are held regularly in different cities in India and in other countries. They are shown on many television channels like Sanskar TV and Sanatan TV.\nBirth and early life.\nJagadguru Rambhadracharya was born in Shandikhurd village of Jaunpur district in the state of Uttar Pradesh, India. His family was a Saryupareen Brahmin family of Vasishtha \"Gotra\". His birth time was 10:34\u00a0pm and he was born on the Makar Sankranti day of Saturday, January\u00a014,\u00a01950 (Magha Krishna Ekadashi). His mother was Shachidevi and his father was Pandit Rajdev Mishra. His name \"Giridhara\" was named by his father's aunt, a cousin of his grandfather Pandit Suryabali Mishra. His father's aunt was an admirer of Mirabai, a female saint of the Bhakti age in middle India, who used the name Giridhara for Krishna in her compositions.\nBlindness.\nGiridhara became blind in March 1950 when he was aged two months. When he got the eye disease trachoma, there was no medical care in his village. He was taken to a local woman who was known to cure Trachoma. She dropped a hot medicine into his eyes to break the Trachoma lumps, but his eyes started bleeding and he became blind. His family took him to many Ayurvedic, Homeopathic, Allopathic and medical doctors in Sitapur, Lucknow and Mumbai, but there was no help. He cannot read or write, as he does not use the Braille system, but learns by listening and composes by dictating to secretaries.\nFirst musical work.\nAs Giridhara's father used to work in Bombay, his early learning was at home from his grandfather. During afternoons, his grandfather used to tell him various parts of the Ramayana, the Mahabharata and other books like \"Vishramsagar\", \"Sukhsagar\", \"Premsagar\", and \"Brajvilas\", etc. When he was of 3 years, Giridhara made his first poem in Hindi (Avadhi), which was the following \"pada\".

His neighbour, Pandit Murlidhar Mishra, helped him. On the Janmashtami day in 1955, he read out the whole Bhagavad Gita. By accident, 52\u00a0years after the day he learnt the Gita, he released the first ever Braille form of Gita at New Delhi on November\u00a030,\u00a02007, with the real Sanskrit text and a Hindi series of comments. When Giridhara was seven years old, he learned the whole Ramcharitmanas of Tulsidas (close to 10,900\u00a0verses) in 60\u00a0days. His grandfather helped him. On Ram Navmi day of 1957, he spoke the whole book while not eating food because of religious reasons. After that, Giridhara went on to learn the Vedas, Upanishads, books on Sanskrit grammar, the Bhagavata Puran, all books of Tulasidas and many other books.\nHis \"Upanayana\" (A sacred thread ceremony) was done on the Nirjala Ekadashi day of June\u00a024,\u00a01961. On this day, he got the Gayatri Mantra, and he was given Diksha into the Mantra of R\u0101ma by Pandit Ishvardas Maharaj of Ayodhya. After learning Gita and Ramcharitmanas to high level of skills at a very young age, Giridhara started visiting the Katha programmes held one time in 3 years (in the Purushottama month) near his village. When he went to the third event, he showed a Katha on Ramcharitmanas which was highly respected by many famous representers of the Katha art.\nOfficial Learning.\nSchooling.\nOn 7\u00a0July,\u00a01967, Giridhara Mi\u015bra joined the Adarsh Gaurishankar Sanskrit College in Jaunpur to study Sanskrit Grammar as well Hindi, English, Maths, History and Geography. As he has the ability to memorize everything by just listening it one time, he never used Braille or other help to learn. In three months, he had learned the whole Laghusiddh\u0101ntakaumud\u012b of Varadar\u0101ja to a high level. He was the best student and got most marks in tests in his class for four years, passing the primary to secondary tests in Sanskrit with best grades and a thing which makes him better than others.\nFirst composition in Sanskrit.\nWhen Girihara was in Adarsh Gaurishankar Sanskrit College, he learnt the eight Ga\u1e47as while learning \"Chandaprabh\u0101\", a book on Sanskrit poetic metre. On the next day, he made his first Sanskrit poetic form, in the \"Bhuja\u1e45gapray\u0101ta\" metre.\nDevanagari&lt;br&gt;\n\"\u092e\u0939\u093e\u0918\u094b\u0930\u0936\u094b\u0915\u093e\u0917\u094d\u0928\u093f\u0928\u093e\u0924\u092a\u094d\u092f\u092e\u093e\u0928\u0902\" \n\"\u092a\u0924\u0928\u094d\u0924\u0902 \u0928\u093f\u0930\u093e\u0938\u093e\u0930\u0938\u0902\u0938\u093e\u0930\u0938\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0927\u094c \u0964\" \n\"\u0905\u0928\u093e\u0925\u0902 \u091c\u0921\u0902 \u092e\u094b\u0939\u092a\u093e\u0936\u0947\u0928 \u092c\u0926\u094d\u0927\u0902\" \n\"\u092a\u094d\u0930\u092d\u094b \u092a\u093e\u0939\u093f \u092e\u093e\u0902 \u0938\u0947\u0935\u0915\u0915\u094d\u0932\u0947\u0936\u0939\u0930\u094d\u0924\u094d\u0924\u0903 \u0965\" \nIAST&lt;br&gt;\nmah\u0101ghora\u015bok\u0101gnin\u0101tapyam\u0101na\u1e43 \npatanta\u1e43 nir\u0101s\u0101rasa\u1e43s\u0101rasindhau \u0964 \nan\u0101tha\u1e43 ja\u1e0da\u1e43 mohap\u0101\u015bena baddha\u1e43 \nprabho p\u0101hi m\u0101\u1e43 sevakakle\u015bahartta\u1e25 \u0965 \nHigher Learning.\nIn 1971, Giridhara Mi\u015bra entered at the Sampurnanand Sanskrit University in Varanasi for higher learning of Vy\u0101kara\u1e47a. He got most marks in the final test for the \"\u015a\u0101str\u012b\" (three years' first degree) in 1974. He then registered for a Master's degree at the same university. While trying to get the master's degree, he went New Delhi to take part in many national contests at the \"Akhila Bh\u0101rat\u012bya Sanskrit Adhive\u015bana\" (All-India Sanskrit Conference). There he won five gold medals in Vy\u0101kara\u1e47a, S\u0101\u1e45khya, Ny\u0101ya, Ved\u0101nta and Sanskrit Anty\u0101k\u1e63ar\u012b out of eight. Then the Prime Minister of India, Indira Gandhi, gave the five gold medals with the \"Calavaijayant\u012b\" prize for Uttar Pradesh to Giridhara. Surprised by his abilities, Indira Gandhi gave him the offer to send him to the United States of America for medical care of his eyes, but Giridhara Mi\u015bra did not accepted this offer. In 1976, he got most marks in the final \"\u0100c\u0101rya\" (two years' Master's degree) tests in Vy\u0101kara\u1e47a, he also won seven gold awards and the \"Chancellor's gold award\". In an uncommon achievement, though he had registered for a master's degree in Vy\u0101kara\u1e47a only, he was made \"\u0100c\u0101rya\" of all subjects which were taught at the university for his all-round qualities on April\u00a030,\u00a01976.\nHighest degree and post-doctorate.\nGiridhara began studying for a PhD also at Sampurnanand Sanskrit University. Pandit Ramprasad Tripathi supervised his studies. Giridhara got a scholarship from the \"University Grants Commission\" (UGC) by passing an examination. However, he had money problem for several years. He completed his PhD in Sanskrit grammar on October\u00a014,\u00a01981. He wrote about the language of the poet P\u0101\u1e47in\u012b in the Ramayana. UGC then offered him a job as head of the Vy\u0101kara\u1e47a department of the Sampurnanand Sanskrit University. However, Giridhara Mi\u015bra did not take the job. He decided to give his life to the service of his religion, the world, and the disabled.\nIn 1997 he was awarded the post-doctorate V\u0101caspati (DLitt) degree by Sampurnanand Sanskrit University for his lecture called \"Search into spoken knowledge of every S\u016btra of the A\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101dhy\u0101y\u012b\" in English (Original title: \"A\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101dhy\u0101yy\u0101\u1e25 Pratis\u016btra\u1e43 \u015a\u0101bdabodhasam\u012bk\u1e63a\u1e47am\"). He described each phrase of the sutra carefully. He told about P\u0101\u1e47in\u012b's grammar and use of Sanskrit poetic forms.\nLater life.\nVirakta Diksha.\nIn 1976, Giridhara Mi\u015bra said aloud a Kath\u0101 on R\u0101mcaritam\u0101nasa to Sv\u0101m\u012b Karap\u0101tr\u012b. Sv\u0101m\u012b Karap\u0101tr\u012b advised him not to marry, to live a lifelong Brahmac\u0101rin, and to take start in a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava Samprad\u0101ya. Giridhara Mi\u015bra took Vairagi start (Virakta D\u012bk\u1e63\u0101) in the R\u0101m\u0101nanda Samprad\u0101ya (monastic order) on the K\u0101rtika full-moon day of November\u00a019,\u00a01983 from \u015ar\u012b \u015ar\u012b 1008 \u015ar\u012b R\u0101macara\u1e47ad\u0101sa Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Ph\u0101l\u0101h\u0101r\u012b. He now came to be known as R\u0101mabhadrad\u0101sa.\nRambhadradas had a six month \"Payovrata\", which is a diet only of milk and fruits, at Chitrakoot in 1979 per the following fifth verse of the \"Dohavali\" made by Tulsidas.\nIn 1987 Rambhadradas established a religious and social service institution in Chitrakoot, where, as per the Ramayana, Rama had spent twelve out of his fourteen years of exile. Its name is Tulsi Peeth (the seat of Tulsi). As he is the founder of the institution, Sadhus gave him the title of \"\u015ar\u012bcitrak\u016b\u1e6datulas\u012bp\u012b\u1e6dh\u0101dh\u012b\u015bvara\" (which means the God of the Tulsi Peeth at Chitrakoot). In the Tulsi Peeth, there a temple of Rama and Sita, and its name is Kanch Mandir (\"glass temple\").\nTitle of Jagadguru Ramanandacharya.\nRambhadradas was made Jagadguru Ramanandacharya seated at the Tulsi Peeth by the Kashi Vidwat Parishad in Varanasi on 24 June 1988, and this order was supported by the \"Mahants\" of three \"Akharas\", the four sub-\"Sampradayas\", the \"Khalsas\" and saints of the Ramananda Sampradaya on 3\u00a0February\u00a01989, at the \"Kumbh Mela\" in Allahabad. On 1\u00a0August\u00a01995 he was anointed as the \"Jagadguru Ramanandacharya\" in a ritual manner in Ayodhya by the \"Digambar Akhara\". After that he is known as \"Jagadguru Ramanandacharya Swami Rambhadracharya\".\nInstitutes for the disabled.\nSwami Rambhadracharya started the Tulsi School for the Blind in Chitrakoot on 23\u00a0August\u00a01996. He also started the Jagadguru Rambhadracharya Handicapped University in Chitrakoot on 27\u00a0September\u00a02001. This is the first university in the world entirely for disabled students. It was created by a local law of the Uttar Pradesh Government, which was afterwards accepted as the Uttar Pradesh State Act 32 (2001) by the Uttar Pradesh legislature. This act assigned Jagadguru Rambhadracharya as the chancellor of this university for his entire life. The university offers graduate, post-graduate and doctorate degrees in many arts and sciences. The university is planning to give courses in Ayurveda and Medical Sciences from 2013. The permission to enter into the university is limited to only four types of disabled students \u2013 those who are blind, or have difficulty in hearing, having difficulty in walking or having some mental illness, as defined in the Disability Act (1995) of the Government of India. According to the Government of Uttar Pradesh, the university is one of the main education institutes for Information Technology and Electronics in the state. Various degrees were given to 354 disabled students in the second graduation ceremony of the university which was held in March 2010. In the third graduation ceremony which was held in January 2011, 388 disabled students were given degrees.\nRambhadracharya also founded an organisation. Its name is Jagadguru Rambhadracharya Viklang Seva Sangh. Its based in Satna, Madhya Pradesh. Its mission is to make community awareness and to start child development programs in Indian villages. Its main aim is to support the education programs of Jagadguru Rambhadracharya Handicapped University. It helps disabled children get a good education by making access to education easier. Rambhadracharya also runs a hundred-bed hospital in Gujarat.\nRambhadracharya's edition of Ramcharitmanas.\nTulsidas wrote the epic poem Ramcharitmanas in the late sixteenth century. It has been very popular in northern India ever since. Some Western scholars have called it the \"Bible of northern India\". Many different poets have created their own versions of the poem."}

A MO is a mathematical function which describes the wave-like behaviour of an electron in a molecule. The functions can tell the probability of finding an electron in any specific region. Chemists use such functions to predict or explain chemical and physical properties.\nChemists usually build mathematical models of molecular orbitals by combining atomic orbitals. Hybrid orbitals from each atom of the molecule, or other molecular orbitals from groups of atoms can also be used. Computers can work on these functions. Molecular orbitals allow chemists to apply quantum mechanics to study molecules. MOs answer questions about how the atoms in molecules stick together. The various rounded shapes in an orbital diagram indicate where electrons would most likely be found in an atom. \nHistory.\nThe word \"orbital\" was first used in English by Robert S. Mulliken. The German physicist Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger wrote about MOs earlier. Schr\u00f6dinger called them \"Eigenfunktion\".\nPhysicist Max Born described the theory behind molecular orbitals in 1926. Today, it is known as Born's rule and is part of the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics. When initially proposed, this theory did not agree with the atom model of Niels Bohr. Bohr's model described electrons as \"orbiting\" the nucleus, as they moved around in circles. However, the Born model eventually gained popular support because it was able to describe the locations of electrons within molecules and explained a number of previously inexplicable chemical reactions.\nOverview.\nAtomic orbitals predict the position of an electron in an atom. Molecular orbitals are created when atomic orbitals are brought together. A molecular orbital can give information about the electron configuration of a molecule. The electron configuration is the most likely position, and the energy of one (or one pair of) electron(s). Mostly a MO is represented as a linear combination of atomic orbitals (the LCAO-MO method), especially in approximate use. This means that chemists assume the chance of an electron being at any point in the molecule is the sum of the probabilities of the electron being there based on the individual atomic orbitals. LCAO-MO is a simple model of bonding in molecules, and is important for studying molecular orbital theory.\nTheoretical chemists use computers to calculate the MOs of different molecules (both real and imaginary). The computer can draw graphs of the \"cloud\" to show how likely the electron will be in any region. The computers can also give information about the physical properties of the molecule. They can also say how much energy is required to form the molecule. This helps chemists say whether some small molecules can be combined to make bigger molecules.\nMost present-day ways of doing computational chemistry begin by calculating the MOs of a system. Each MO's electric field is generated by the nuclei of all the atoms and some average distribution of the other electrons.\nAnalogy.\nUnderstanding MOs is like the task of knowing where each employee is in a large home improvement store (without looking inside the store). An analyst knows the number of employees working at the store and each employee's department. He also knows that employees do not step on each other toes and employees stand in the aisle rather than on the merchandise shelves. Employees leave their own department to help customers locate merchandise in other departments or to check inventory. An analyst giving the location of all employees in the store at a selected moment without looking inside is like a chemist calculating the MOs of a molecule. Just as MOs cannot tell the exact location of each electron, the exact location of each employee is not known. An MO having a nodal plane is like the conclusion that employees walk down aisles and not through shelves. Although electrons are contributed from a specific atom, the electron fills an MO without regard to its source atom. This is like an employee leaving his department to walk elsewhere in the store during the day. So, an MO is an incomplete description of an electron just as the analyst's calculations about the unseen store is an incomplete guess about employee locations.\nFormation of molecular orbitals.\nTheoretical chemists have invented rules for calculating MOs. These rules come from an understanding of quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics helps chemists to use what physics said about electrons to work out how the electrons behave in molecules.\nMolecular orbitals form from \"allowed\" interactions between atomic orbitals. (The interactions are \"allowed\" if the symmetries (determined from group theory) of the atomic orbitals are compatible with each other.) Chemists study atomic orbital interactions. These interactions come from the overlap (a measure of how well two orbitals constructively interact with one another) between two atomic orbitals. The overlap is important if the atomic orbitals are close in energy. Finally, the number of MOs in a molecule must equal the number of atomic orbitals in the atoms being brought together to form the molecule.\nQualitative approach.\nChemists need to understand the geometry of MOs in order to discuss molecular structure. The LCMO (Linear combination of atomic orbitals molecular orbital) method gives a rough but good description of the MOs. In this method, the molecular orbitals are expressed as linear combinations of all of the atomic orbitals of each atom in the molecule.\nLinear combinations of atomic orbitals (LCAO).\nMolecular orbitals were first introduced by Friedrich Hund and Robert S. Mulliken in 1927 and 1928.\nThe linear combination of atomic orbitals or \"LCAO\" approximation for molecular orbitals was introduced in 1929 by Sir John Lennard-Jones. His ground-breaking paper showed how to derive the electronic structure of the fluorine and oxygen molecules from quantum principles. This qualitative approach to molecular orbital theory is part of the start of modern quantum chemistry.\nLinear combinations of atomic orbitals (LCAO) can be used to guess the molecular orbitals that are made when the molecule\u2019s atoms bond together. Similar to an atomic orbital, a Schrodinger equation, which describes the behavior of an electron, can be constructed for a molecular orbital as well. Linear combinations of atomic orbitals, (the sums and differences of the atomic wavefunctions) provide approximate solutions to the molecular Schrodinger equations. For simple diatomic molecules, the wavefunctions that you get are represented mathematically by the equations\n\u03a8 = ca\u03c8a + cb\u03c8b\nand\n\u03a8* = ca\u03c8a - cb\u03c8b\nwhere \u03a8 and \u03a8* are the molecular wavefunctions for the bonding and antibonding molecular orbitals, respectively, \u03c8a and \u03c8b are the atomic wavefunctions from atoms a and b, respectively, and ca and cb are adjustable coefficients. These coefficients can be positive or negative, depending on the energies and symmetries of the individual atomic orbitals. As the two atoms become closer together, their atomic orbitals overlap to produce areas of high electron density. So, molecular orbitals are formed between the two atoms. The atoms are held together by the electrostatic attraction between the positively charged nuclei and the negatively charged electrons occupying bonding molecular orbitals.\nBonding, Antibonding, and Nonbonding MOs.\nWhen atomic orbitals interact, the resulting molecular orbital can be of three types: bonding, antibonding, or nonbonding.\nBonding MOs:\nAntibonding MOs: \nNonbonding MOs: \nHOMO and LUMO.\nEach molecular orbital has its own energy level. Chemists sort the MOs by energy levels. Chemists assume that the electrons will fill the lowest energy level MOs first. For example, if a molecule has electrons to fill 15 orbitals, the 15 MOs with the lowest energy levels will be filled. The 15th MO on the list would be called the \"highest occupied molecular orbital\" (HOMO) and the 16th MO on the list would be the \"lowest unoccupied molecular orbital\" (LUMO). The difference in the HOMO's energy level and the LUMO's energy level is called the band gap. The band gap can sometimes serve as a measure of the excitability of the molecule: the smaller the energy, the more easily it will be excited. When the electron is excited, it will jump to an unoccupied MO. For example, this can help guess whether something will give out light (luminescence)."}

Pericyclic reactions are usually rearrangement reactions where the molecule is a ring (e.g. benzene ring). They were written by Robert Burns Woodward (a chemistry professor at Harvard University) and Roald Hoffmann (a chemistry professor at Cornell University). Hoffmann was awarded the 1981 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for this work, shared with Kenichi Fukui who developed a similar model. Woodward did not share the prize because he died two years before. Generally, the Nobel Prize is awarded only to living people. Woodward had already won a Nobel Prize in Chemistry for a different discovery.\nA recent paper in the journal \"Nature\" describes how mechanical stress can be used to reshape chemical reaction pathways to lead to products that apparently violate Woodward\u2013Hoffman rules."}
{"id": "302535", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=302535", "title": "Stereochemistry", "text": "Stereochemistry is the study of how molecules are affected by the way their atoms are arranged in space. It is also known as 3D chemistry as the word \"stereo\" means \"three dimensional\". Using stereochemistry, chemists can work out the relationships between different molecules that are made up from the same atoms. They can also study the effect on the physical or biological properties these relationships give molecules. When these relationships influence the reactivity of the molecules it is called dynamic stereochemistry. \nIn chemistry, some molecules have more than one isomer. This means that molecules can have different forms, even though all the forms made up of the same atoms. There are two kinds of isonomers. Constitutional isomers have the same atoms, but they are joined differently. Stereoisomers have the same atoms, they are joined the same way, but the atoms are arranged differently in space. An important part of stereochemistry is the study of chiral molecules. These molecules look almost identical, except that one molecule is the mirror image of the other.\nIn most chemical bonds, the atoms of a molecule free to move around without breaking the bonds. When a molecule has a double bond or a ring structure, the molecule can be sorted into different isomers. These are molecules with the same chemical structure but different forms.\nThe study of stereochemical problems covers the entire range of organic, inorganic, biological, physical and supramolecular chemistries.\nHistory.\nLouis Pasteur was the first person to study stereochemistry. He observed in 1849 that salts of tartaric acid collected from wine-making equipment could rotate plane polarized light, but that salts from other sources did not. This property was the only difference between the two types of salt. It is due to optical isomerism. In 1874, Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff and Joseph Le Bel discovered the difference was caused by the way that the atoms bonded to carbon in a tetrahedral (four faced) shape.\nUses of stereochemistry.\nStereochemistry was important in solving the thalidomide disaster in the 1960s. Thalidomide is a drug that was first produced in 1957 in Germany. Doctors used it to treat morning sickness in pregnant women. Later, the drug was shown to cause deformations in babies. One isomer of the drug was not dangerous, but the other caused serious genetic damage to the embryos. In the human body, thalidomide undergoes racemization: even if only one of the two stereoisomers enters a human body, the body changes some of it to other one. The thalidomide disaster caused governments to test drugs more carefully. Selected people take new drugs in an experiment (clinical trial) first before the drug is made available for public use. Thalidomide is now used as a therapy for leprosy. Women must use it with contraceptives to prevent pregnancy.\nDescribing a molecule's stereochemistry.\nWhen an atom can have other atoms connect to it in more than one way, it is called a stereocenter. For example, if a carbon atom has four different groups attached to it, it becomes a stereocenter.\nCahn-Ingold-Prelog priority rules are part of a system for describing a molecule's stereochemistry. They rank the atoms around a stereocenter in a standard way. This allows the relative position of these atoms in the molecule to be described very clearly. A Fischer projection is a simplified way to show the stereochemistry around a stereocenter."}

He is a member of the Democratic Socialists of America. West is the Class of 1943 University Professor at Princeton University. He teaches in the Center for African American Studies and in the Department of Religion. West is known for his combination of political and moral insight and criticism and his contribution to the post-1960s civil rights movement. Much of West's work focuses on the role of race, gender, and class in American society and the means by which people act and react to their \"radical conditionedness\". West draws intellectual contributions from such diverse traditions as the African American Baptist Church, pragmatism and transcendentalism.\nEarly life.\nWest was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and grew up in Sacramento, California, where his father was a general contractor for the Defense Department and his mother was a teacher and a principal. Irene B. West Elementary School, Elk Grove, California, is named for her. While West was a student, he marched in civil rights demonstrations. As the class president in his high school, West organized protests demanding black studies courses. He later wrote that, in his youth, he admired \"the sincere black militancy of Malcolm X, the defiant rage of the Black Panther Party [...] and the livid black theology of James Cone.\"\nIn 1970, West graduated from John F. Kennedy High School. He enrolled at Harvard University and took classes from philosophers Robert Nozick and Stanley Cavell. In 1973, he graduated \"magna cum laude\" in Near Eastern Languages and Civilization. \"Owing to my family, church, and the black social movements of the 1960s\", he says, \"I arrived at Harvard unashamed of my African, Christian, and militant de-colonized outlooks. More pointedly, I acknowledged and accented the empowerment of my black styles, mannerisms, and viewpoints, my Christian values of service, love, humility, and struggle, and my anti-colonial sense of self-determination for oppressed people and nations around the world.\"\nCareer.\nPh.D and other degrees.\nIn 1980, he earned a Ph.D. from Princeton, where he was influenced by Richard Rorty's pragmatism. The title of his dissertation was \"Ethics, historicism and the Marxist tradition\", which was later revised and published under the title \"The Ethical Dimensions of Marxist Thought\".\nIn his mid-20s, he returned to Harvard as a W. E. B. Du Bois Fellow before becoming an Assistant Professor at Union Theological Seminary in the City of New York. In 1985, he worked at Yale Divinity School in what eventually became a joint appointment in American Studies. While at Yale, he participated in campus protests for a clerical labor union and divestment from apartheid South Africa. He was arrested and jailed at one of the protests. As punishment, the University administration canceled his leave for Spring 1987, leading him to commute from Yale in New Haven, Connecticut, where he was teaching two classes, across the Atlantic Ocean to the University of Paris.\nHe then returned to Union and taught at Haverford College in Pennsylvania for one year before going to Princeton to become a Professor of Religion and Director of the Program in African-American Studies (1988\u201394). He worked with novelist Toni Morrison to improve the Princeton program.\nIn 1994, West accepted an appointment as Professor of African-American Studies at Harvard University, with a joint appointment at the Harvard Divinity School. West taught one of the University's most popular courses, an introductory class on African-American Studies. In 1998, he was appointed the first Alphonse Fletcher University Professor. This professorship allowed West to teach both African-American studies and Divinity, Religion, and Philosophy.\nIn 2001, after an argument with Harvard President Lawrence Summers, West returned to Princeton, where he has taught ever since.\nThe recipient of more than 20 honorary degrees and an American Book Award, he is a long-time member of the Democratic Socialists of America, for which he now serves as Honorary Chair. He is also a co-chair of the Tikkun Community and the Network of Spiritual Progressives. West is on the Board of Directors of the International Bridges to Justice, among others. West is also much sought-after as a speaker, blurb-writer, and Honorary Chair.\nCritics, most notably \"The New Republic\" Literary Editor Leon Wieseltier, have charged him with opportunism, crass showmanship, and lack of scholarly seriousness.\nWest remains a widely cited scholar in the popular press in African-American Studies and Studies of Black Theology.\nWest is a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity. He is a member of the fraternity's World Policy Council, a think tank whose purpose is to expand Alpha Phi Alpha's involvement in politics and social and current policy to encompass international concerns.\nEntertainment career.\nWest appears in both \"The Matrix Reloaded\" and \"The Matrix Revolutions\", playing Councilor West, who serves on the council of Zion. West's character advises that \"comprehension is not a requisite of cooperation.\" In addition, West provides philosophical commentary on all three Matrix films in The Ultimate Matrix Collection, along with integral theorist Ken Wilber.\nCornel West has also made several appearances in documentary films, such as the 2008 film \"Examined Life\", a documentary featuring several academics discussing philosophy in real-world contexts. West, \"driving through Manhattan, . . . compares philosophy to jazz and blues, reminding us how intense and invigorating a life of the mind can be.\"\nHe also appears in conversation with Bill Withers in the Bill Withers documentary, \"Still Bill\".\nWest also makes frequent appearances on the political talk show \"Real Time with Bill Maher\".\nOn the musical front, West recorded a recitation of John Mellencamp's song \"Jim Crow\" for inclusion on the singer's box set \"On the Rural Route 7609\" in 2009.\nIn 2010, he completed recording with the Cornel West Theory, a Hip Hop band endorsed by West. He has also released two hip-hop/soul/spoken word albums, one under \"Cornel West\" (entitled Street Knowledge), the other under \"Cornel West &amp; B.M.W.M.B.\" (entitled Never Forget: A Journey of Revelations). Both works are musical expressions of West's personal politics and beliefs which he has enunciated in his previous written works.\nDispute with Lawrence Summers.\nIn 2000, economist and former U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers became president of Harvard. In a private meeting with West, Summers allegedly rebuked West for missing too many classes, contributing to grade inflation, neglecting serious scholarship, and spending too much time on his economically profitable projects. Some people say that Summers allegedly suggested that West produce an academic book (work that is typical of senior Harvard professors). West had written several books, some of them widely cited, but his recent output consisted primarily of co-written and edited volumes. According to some reports, Summers also objected to West's production of a CD, the critically panned \"Sketches of My Culture\", and to his political campaigning. According to West's book \"Democracy Matters,\" Summers wrongly accused him of canceling classes for three straight weeks during 2000 to promote Bill Bradley's presidential campaign. West contends that he had missed one class during his tenure at Harvard \"in order to give a keynote address at a Harvard-sponsored conference on AIDS.\" Summers also allegedly suggested that since West held the rank of Harvard University Professor and thus reported directly to the President, he should meet with Summers regularly to discuss the progress of his academic production.\nWest contends that popular coverage of the controversy obscured the true issues at stake in his dispute with Summers. West argues that Summers's vision of academia is corrosive to a deep democratic commitment that strives to connect the academy with society at large, so as to fulfill its calling to educate the public. He contends that the controversy with Summers was indicative of the fact that \"a market-driven technocratic culture has infiltrated university life, with the narrow pursuit of academic trophies and the business of generating income from grants and business partnerships taking precedence over the fundamental responsibility of nurturing young minds.\" According to West, during the controversy he was highly regarded in the academic community, \"had more academic references than fourteen of the other seventeen Harvard University Professors\", and \"had nearly twice as many such references as Summers himself.\" At the time, West had been focused on reaching wider audiences as part of his effort to encourage civic engagement\u2014especially amongst youth\u2014in the hope of revitalizing what he calls a deep democratic commitment that would counteract the encroaching political nihilism that he argues threatens the future of American democracy. While West does not deny the importance of academics engaging the more specialized concerns of their fields, he strongly opposes the sentiment that academia must limit itself to those rarefied interests. Academia and academics, he contends, have an important role to play in promoting public discourse that cannot be achieved if professors lock themselves in their ivory towers instead of engaging society-at-large and the salient issues of the day. Ultimately, this was the root of the quarrel, according to West.\nSummers refused to comment on the details of his conversation with West, except to express hope that West would remain at Harvard. Soon after, West was hospitalized for prostate cancer. West complained that Summers failed to send him get-well wishes until weeks after his surgery, whereas newly installed Princeton president Shirley Tilghman had contacted him frequently before and after his treatment. In 2002 West left Harvard University to return to Princeton. West lashed out at Summers in public interviews, calling him \"the Ariel Sharon of higher education\" on NPR's \"Tavis Smiley Show\". In response to these remarks, five Princeton faculty members, led by professor of molecular biology Jacques Robert Fresco, said they looked with \"strong disfavor upon his characterization\" of Summers and that \"such an analogy carries innuendoes and implications... that many on the Princeton faculty find highly inappropriate, indeed repugnant and intolerable.\"\nHarvard University's undergraduate student newspaper, \"The Harvard Crimson\", suggested in October 2002 that the premise of \"\" episode \"Anti-Thesis\" was based on West's conflicts with Summers.\nDispute with President Barack Obama.\nWest publicly supported 2008 Democratic Presidential candidate Senator Barack Obama. He spoke to over 1,000 of his supporters at the Apollo Theater in Harlem, N.Y.C. on November 29, 2007. However, West now calls Obama a \"black mascot of Wall Street oligarchs and a black puppet of corporate plutocrats.\" In an interview, West said:As a young brother who grows up in a white context, brilliant African father, he's always had to fear being a white main with a black skin. All he has known culturally is white.West's comments about President Obama have drawn criticism from other African-Americans, including Melissa Harris-Perry and Al Sharpton.\nWest criticized President Obama when Obama won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2009, saying that it would be difficult for Obama to be \"a war president with a peace prize\".\nWest recanted his support for Obama in an April 2011 interview, in which he said Obama is merely a \"black mascot\" for America's elites and also \"a black muppet of corporate plutocrats.\"\nActivism.\nViews on race in America.\nWest has called the U.S. a \"racist patriarchal\" nation where \"white supremacy\" continues to define everyday life. \"White America,\" he writes, \"has been historically weak-willed in ensuring racial justice and has continued to resist fully accepting the humanity of blacks.\" This has resulted, he claims, in the creation of many \"degraded and oppressed people hungry for identity, meaning, and self-worth.\" Professor West attributes most of the black community's problems to \"existential angst derive[d] from the lived experience of ontological wounds and emotional scars inflicted by white supremacist beliefs and images permeating U.S. society and culture.\"\nIn West's view, the September 11, 2001 attacks gave white Americans a glimpse of what it means to be a black person in the United States\u2014feeling \"unsafe, unprotected, subject to random violence, and hatred\" for who they are. \"The ugly terrorist attacks on innocent civilians on 9/11,\" he said, \"plunged the whole country into the blues.\"\nPolitics.\nWest has described himself as a \"non-Marxist socialist\" (partly due to Marx's opposition to religion) and serves as honorary chair of the Democratic Socialists of America, which he has described as \"the first multiracial, socialist organization close enough to my politics that I could join\". He also described himself as a \"radical democrat, suspicious of all forms of authority\" on the \"Matrix\"-themed documentary \"The Burly Man Chronicles\" (Found in \"The Ultimate Matrix Collection\").\nWest believes that \"the overthrow of Saddam Hussein's ugly totalitarian regime was desirable,\" but that the war in Iraq was the result of \"dishonest manipulation\" on the part of the Bush administration. He asserts that Bush Administration hawks \"are not simply conservative elites and right-wing ideologues\", but rather are \"evangelical nihilists \u2014 drunk with power and driven by grand delusions of American domination of the world\". He adds, \"We are experiencing the sad gangsterization of America, an unbridled grasp at power, wealth, and status.\" Viewing capitalism as the root cause of these alleged American lusts, West warns, \"Free-market fundamentalism trivializes the concern for public interest. It puts fear and insecurity in the hearts of anxiety-ridden workers. It also makes money-driven, poll-obsessed elected officials deferential to corporate goals of profit \u2014 often at the cost of the common good.\"\nWest has been involved with such projects as the Million Man March and Russell Simmons's Hip-Hop Summit, and worked with such public figures as Louis Farrakhan and Al Sharpton, whose 2004 presidential campaign West advised.\nIn 2000, West worked as a senior advisor to Democratic presidential candidate Bill Bradley. When Bradley lost in the primaries, West became a prominent endorser of Ralph Nader, even speaking at some Nader rallies. Some Greens sought to draft West to run as a presidential candidate in 2004. West declined, citing his active participation in the Al Sharpton campaign. West, along with other prominent Nader 2000 supporters, signed the \"Vote to Stop Bush\" statement urging progressive voters in swing states to vote for John Kerry, despite strong disagreements with many of Kerry's policies.\nIn April 2002 West and Rabbi Michael Lerner performed an act of civil disobedience at the U.S. State Department \"in solidarity with suffering Palestinian and Israeli brothers and sisters\". West said, \"We must keep in touch with the humanity of both sides.\" In May 2007 West joined a demonstration against \"injustices faced by the Palestinian people resulting from the Israeli occupation\" and \"to bring attention to this 40 year travesty of justice\". In 2011, West called on the University of Arizona to divest from companies profiting from the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian Territories.\nWest also serves as co-chair of the Tikkun Community. He co-chaired the National Parenting Organization's Task Force on Parent Empowerment and participated in President Clinton's National Conversation on Race. He has publicly endorsed \"In These Times\" magazine by calling it: \"The most creative and challenging news magazine of the American left\". He is also a contributing editor for \"Sojourners Magazine\".\nWest supports of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA.) in its Kentucky Fried Cruelty campaign, aimed at eliminating what PETA describes as KFC's inhumane treatment of chickens. West is quoted on PETA flyers: \"Although most people don't know chickens as well as they know cats and dogs, chickens are interesting individuals with personalities and interests every bit as developed as the dogs and cats with whom many of us share our lives.\"\nIn 2008, West contributed his insights on the current global issue of modernized slavery and human trafficking in the rockumentary Call+Response.\nWest is a member of the Campaign for Peace and Democracy.\nDuring the 2016 United States presidential election, West was a strong supporter and campaigned for Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders. After Sanders lost the Democratic nomination, West supported Jill Stein of the Green Party."}

{"id": "302580", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=302580", "title": "Upper Palaeolithic", "text": "The Upper Palaeolithic (Upper Paleolithic or Late Stone Age) is the third and last part of the Palaeolithic period. It lasted from about 40,000 to 10,000 years ago. Humans used tools for hunting and fishing. They also developed cave paintings. In this period, the Neanderthal man completely disappeared, leaving Homo sapiens as the only surviving species in the human genus.\nIn Europe, Asia and Africa, this time is known as the last part of the Old Stone Age.\nThe first \"modern humans\" found in Western Europe date back to about 36,000 years ago. Those fossils were found in the south-west of Romania. The founds were made in a stone cave called Pe\u0219tera cu Oase.\nThe Lascaux cave paintings are from this time period. They are part of the UNESCO World Heritage Sites since 1979 and are in France.\nEvidence for belief in the afterlife in the Upper Palaeolithic: appearance of burial rituals and ancestor worship.\nCulture.\nVenus figurines.\nPossibly among the earliest traces of art are Venus figurines. These are \"figurines\" (very small statues) of women, mostly pregnant with visible breasts. The figurines were found in areas of Western Europe to Siberia. Most are between 20,000 and 30,000 years old. Two figurines have been found that are much older: the Venus of Tan-Tan, dated to 300,000 to 500,000 years ago was found in Morocco. The Venus of Berekhat Ram was found on the Golan Heights. It has been dated to 200,000 to 300,000 years ago. It may be the one of the earliest things that show the human form. \nDifferent kinds of stone, bones and ivory were used to make the figurines. Some are also made of clay which was then burned in a fire. This is one of the earliest known traces of the use of ceramics.\nToday it is not known what the figurines meant to the people who made them. There are two basic theories:\nScientists have excluded that these figurines were linked to the fertility of fields, because agriculture had not been discovered at the time the figurines were made.\nThe two figurines that are older may have mostly formed by natural processes. The Venus of Tan-Tan was covered with a substance that could have been some kind of paint. The substance contained traces of iron and manganese. The figurine of Berekhat Ram shows traces that someone worked on it with a tool. A study done in 1997 states that these traces could not have been left by nature alone.\nCave paintings.\nCave paintings are paintings that were made on the walls or roofs of caves. Many cave paintings belong to the Palaeolothic Age, and date from about 15,000 to 30,000 years ago. Among the most famous are those in the caves of Altamira in Spain and Lascaux in France.p545 There are about 350 caves in Europe where cave paintings have been found. Usually, animals have been painted, like aurochs, bisons or horses. Why these paintings were done is not known. They are not simply decorations of places where people lived. The caves they were found in usually do not show signs that someone lived in them.\nOne of the oldest caves is that of Chauvet in France. Paintings in the cave fall into two groups. One has been dated to around 30,000 to 33,000 years ago, the other to 26,000 or 27,000 years ago.p546 The oldest known cave paintings, based on radiocarbon dating of \"black from drawings, from torch marks and from the floors\". As of 1999, the dates of 31 samples from the cave have been reported. The oldest paintings have been dated from 32,900\u00b1490 years ago.\nSome archaeologists have questioned the dating. Z\u00fcchner believe the two groups date from 23,000\u201324,000, and 10,000\u201318,000 years ago. Pettitt and Bahn believe the dating is inconsistent. They say the people at that periods of time painted things differently. They also do not know where the charcoal used to paint some things is from, and how big the painted area is.\nPeople from the Palaeolithic era drew well. They knew about perspective, and they knew of different ways to draw things. They also were able to observe the behaviour of animals they painted. Some of the paintings show how the painted animals behaved. The paintings may have been important for rituals."}

It is centered at the intersection of 18th Street and Columbia Road. Adams Morgan is the center of Washington's Hispanic immigrant community. It is a major night life area with many bars and restaurants, particularly along 18th Street (the primary commercial district) and Columbia Road. Much of the neighborhood has 19th- and early 20th-century row houses and apartment buildings. \nAdjacent to Adams Morgan is Dupont Circle to the south, Kalorama-Sheridan to the southwest, Mount Pleasant to the north, and Columbia Heights to the east. The neighborhood is bounded by Connecticut Avenue to the southwest, Rock Creek Park to the west, Harvard Street to the north, 16th Street to the east, and Florida Avenue to the south. \nHistory.\nThe name Adams Morgan was originally hyphenated. It is derived from the names of two, formerly segregated area elementary schools\u2014the older, all-black Thomas P. Morgan Elementary School (now defunct) and the all-white John Quincy Adams Elementary School. Pursuant to the 1954 \"Bolling v. Sharpe\" Supreme Court ruling, District schools were desegregated in 1955. The Adams-Morgan Community Council, comprising both Adams and Morgan schools and the neighborhoods they served, was formed in 1958. The city drew boundaries of the neighborhood through three preexisting neighborhoods \u2013 Washington Heights, Lanier Heights, and Meridian Hill \u2013 naming the resulting area after both schools.\nIn the late 1960s, a group of residents organized and worked with city officials to plan and construct a new elementary school and recreational complex that was conceived as a community hub, a concept that 40 years later has become a favored one in public school facilities design. The development was named the Marie H. Reed Learning Center after Bishop Reed, a community activist, minister and leader. It featured a daycare center, tennis and basketball courts, a solar-heated swimming pool, health clinic, athletic field and outdoor chess tables.\nCultural diversity.\nAdams Morgan, together with the nearby Mount Pleasant and Columbia Heights, serve as a gateway community for immigrants. Since the 1960s, the predominant international presence in both communities has been Latino, with the majority of immigrants coming from El Salvador, Guatemala and other Central American countries. Since the early 1970s, like other areas of the nation, Adams Morgan had seen a growing influx of immigrants from Africa, Asia and the Caribbean, as well. Gentrification and the resulting high cost of housing, however, have displaced many immigrants and long-time African American residents, particularly those with young children. Many small businesses have also been displaced. The community still retains a degree of diversity, most evident in its array of international shops and restaurants. Restaurants in Adams Morgan offer ethnic cuisines, among them Spanish, Ethiopian, Guatemalan, Mexican, Italian, Dutch, Vietnamese, Ghanaian, Cajun, Brazilian, Palestinian, Peruvian, Pakistani cuisine, Thai, Lebanese, Somali, and Chinese.\nAdams Morgan also has become a thriving spot for night life, with a number of bars and clubs featuring live music. Over 90 establishments possess liquor licenses, putting it on level with other popular nightlife areas like Georgetown and Dupont Circle. Local stores along the 18th Street corridor were rapidly replaced with late-night establishments, leading to a moratorium on new liquor licenses by the Alcohol Beverage Control Board in 2000 after successful lobbying by resident groups. The moratorium was renewed in 2004, but eased to allow new restaurant licenses.\nAlthough many immigrants and African-American residents have left Adams Morgan, the long-time institutions that meet the needs of Latinos and other non English-speaking residents ontinue to serve immigrants and their families. Adams Morgan is home to Mary's Center, a clinic focusing on healthcare delivery to Spanish-speaking patients, and the Latino Economic Development Corporation, as well as numerous businesses and churches that employ and cater to immigrants. Adjacent Mt. Pleasant also hosts a number of commercial enterprises, social service agencies and other institutions that help to anchor local immigrants to the area.\nAdams Morgan continues to show linguistic and cultural diversity of its public schools. Many of the families served live beyond the boundaries established for routine student enrollment; however, Adams, Reed, and H.D. Cooke elementary schools all have international populations, with children from well over 30 nations in attendance. Latino and African-American children comprise the majority of students in the public schools, and virtually all are children of color. \nThe second Sunday of September, the neighborhood hosts the Adams Morgan Day Festival, a multicultural street celebration with live music and food and crafts booths. And, weather permitting, every Saturday\u2014except during the coldest winter months\u2014local growers sell fresh, organically grown produce and herbs; baked and canned goods; cheeses; cold-pressed apple juice and fresh flowers at the farmers market, in operation in the same location for more than 30 years. Also on summer Saturdays, the Western Art Market is open at the Marie Reed School.\nIn the 1960s, the neighborhood's attractions included the Avignon Freres bakery and restaurant, the Caf\u00e9 Don restaurant, the Ontario motion picture theater, and the Showboat Lounge jazz nightclub. In the 1980s, Hazel's featured live blues and jazz. Its soul food offerings made it a favorite of black jazz musicians like Dizzy Gillespie when they came to town.\nTransportation.\nThe area is not directly served by the Metrorail system. The nearest station, Woodley Park-Zoo/Adams Morgan (Red Line) is in the Woodley Park neighborhood, but was renamed in 1999 to reflect the station's proximity to Adams Morgan. The nearest station on the Green Line is Columbia Heights. In March 2009, the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) began operating a DC Circulator bus route connecting the center of Adams Morgan with both Metro stations. The area is also served by a number of WMATA Metrobus lines.\nPolitics.\nAdams Morgan is in the service area of Advisory Neighborhood Commission 1C. The boundaries of ANC 1C are 16th Street NW on the east, Harvard Street NW and Rock Creek Park on the north, Rock Creek Park and Connecticut Avenue on the west, and Florida Avenue and U Street on the south."}

The square is between 4th and 5th Streets, with D Street to the south and F Street to the north.\nAmong the buildings in Judiciary Square are:\nThe neighborhood is served by the Judiciary Square station on the Red Line of the Washington Metro.\nHistory.\nDuring the first half of the 19th century, Judiciary Square was mostly residential. Its proximity to the courthouses drew a number of lawyers, judges, and clerks to the neighborhood, while its location between the White House and the Capitol made it ideal for government employees. Among its most prominent residents were Missouri Senator Thomas Hart Benton, Vice President John C. Calhoun, and Daniel Webster. As of 2006, however, nearly all of the once plentiful rowhouses in the area were gone, with the remaining houses mostly centered around the intersection of 5th and D Streets.\nAround the turn of the 20th century, the eastern side of Judiciary Square became an enclave of Italian immigrants in Washington - the equivalent of a Little Italy (although it was never called that). The Italian neighborhood rested on the eastern edge of the square proper, stretching eastward to about 2nd Street NW. The heart of the community was Holy Rosary Church, a chapel built at 3rd and F Streets NW. The neighborhood lasted well into the 20th century, with a particular surge of Italian immigrants in the 1950s and 60s; in the mid 1970s, however, construction of the I-395 northbound extension through the city gutted about half of the neighborhood and forced its remaining residents to move away from the heavy commuter traffic. Today the former Italian enclave is dominated by Federal office buildings and law offices for the trial attorneys who argue in Judiciary Square courthouses, although Holy Rosary Church remains standing and continues to draw a heavily Italian congregation along with its \"Casa Italia\" cultural center next door."}

The transitional zone is sometimes called \"Wallacea\".\nPlants and animals related to Asian species are found to the north-west. Australasian species are found mainly to the south-east, with some Asian species. The line is named after Alfred Russel Wallace, who noticed this clear dividing line during his travels through the East Indies in the 19th century. \nThe line runs through Indonesia, between Borneo and Sulawesi (Celebes); and through the Lombok Strait between Bali (in the west) and Lombok (in the east). \nThe distance between Bali and Lombok is only about 35 kilometers. Surprisingly, the distributions of many bird species observe the line, because many birds do not cross even the smallest stretches of open ocean water. Some bats have distributions that cross the Wallace Line, but other mammals are generally limited to one side or the other; an exception is the Crab-eating Macaque. Other groups of plants and animals show differing patterns, but the overall pattern is striking and reasonably consistent.\nThe term 'Wallace's Line' was first used by Huxley in 1868.\nCause.\nThe root cause of Wallace's line is that the ancient supercontinent Gondwana was separated entirely from other parts of the world after Pangaea broke up. Australasia and its smaller islands were part of Gondwana, and that is why their fauna is so different from that of south-east Asia. Wallace's line marks where part of the old Gondwana plate touches part of the old Laurasia plate.\nIce age.\nDuring Quaternary ice age cold periods, when the , both Asia and Australia were joined with their respective islands. The deep water between those two large continental shelf areas was \u2014 for over 50 million years \u2014 a barrier that kept the flora and fauna of Australia separated from that of Asia. Wallacea consists of islands that were never recently connected by dry land to either of the continental land masses, and thus was populated by organisms capable of crossing the straits between islands. 'Weber's Line' runs through this area (rather to the east of centre), at the tipping point between dominance by species of Asian vs. species of Australian origin."}

It can mean a person who enjoys computers and knows a lot about them. It used to mean a carnival worker \"who bit the heads off of chickens and rats.\" One dictionary says that a geek is \"a peculiar or otherwise dislikable person, especially one who is perceived to be overly intellectual\". This means \"a strange and un-likeable person, especially one who is thought to be very clever\", in simple English.\nHistory.\nThis word comes from English dialect words (words that are used in certain places) \"geek, geck\": fool, freak; from Low German \"geck\", from Middle Low German. A different form of the word \"geck\" is still used in Dutch and Afrikaans \"gek\": crazy. Other forms of \"geck\" are also used in some German dialects, and in the Alsatian word \"Gickeleshut\": geek's hat, used in carnivals.\nIn 18th century Austria-Hungary, \"Gecken\" were freaks shown by some circuses.\nIn 19th century, in North-America, the term \"geek\" referred to a freak in circus side-shows (see also freak show). In some cases, its performance included biting the head off a live chicken. The 1976 edition of the \"American Heritage Dictionary\" included only the definition regarding geek shows.\nThe word is often used to be rude or mean to someone. However, it can also be used without meaning to be hurtful, or with pride. An example is the 'Geek Squad' of the Best Buy company.\nMeanings.\nThe meaning of geek has changed much over time, and there is no longer a single meaning. The words nerd, gimp, dweeb, dork, spod and gump have similar meanings as geek. But many people choose to say that these words mean slightly different things. However, the differences are not agreed on. In a 2007 interview on \"The Colbert Report\", Richard Clarke said the difference between nerds and geeks is \"geeks get it done.\" Julie Smith described a geek as \"a bright young man turned inward, poorly socialized, who felt so little kinship with his own planet that he routinely traveled to the ones invented by his favorite authors, who thought of that secret, dreamy place his computer took him to as cyberspace\u2014somewhere exciting, a place more real than his own life, a land he could conquer, not a drab teenager's room in his parents' house.\"\nOther meanings include:\nEtymology.\nThe word \"geek\" is in Robert Heinlein's 1952 short story \"The Year of the Jackpot\". The word appears meaning the modern definition.\nReclamation and self-identification.\nBeing called a \"geek\" is usually an insult. The word is now often a nice thing to say, meaning that the person it is describing has extraordinary technical skill. Geek Pride Day has been observed on May 25 in Spain since 2006 (May 25 being the world premiere date of Star Wars and also Towel Day). The holiday promotes the right to be nerdy or geeky, and to express it in public without feeling bad. A new meeting, Geek.Kon, is held in Madison, Wisconsin to celebrate all things geek.\nThe website BoardGameGeek is an online community of boardgamers who see themselves as geeks at boardgame meetings; they call their website \"The Geek\", for short. Technical support services such as Geek Squad use the term \"geek\" to show that they have helpful technical abilities. In recent history, some geeks have grown a geek culture, such as geek humor and odd references on t-shirts. The so-called \"geek chic\" trend is a deliberate affectation of geek or nerd traits as a fashion statement. Nonetheless, the derogatory definition of geeks remains that of a person only thinking about his area of interest at the cost of social skills, personal hygiene, and status.\nThere has been criticism over the widespread appropriation of the terms \"geek\" and \"nerd\" as self descriptors. Certain people who would have most likely not been described as such under the traditional stereotype have argued this. Along with efforts to de-emphasize the negative social aspects, in recent years there have been arguments for de-emphasizing the necessity for having noticeably high levels of intelligence or technical aptitude. This has resulted in the desire to redefine the term geek rather as any person who pursues a passionate interest in anything regardless of genre, is creative, and individualistic. Arguments against the revisionist definitions, however, state that it is not only unnecessary, but it completely contradicts the traditional accepted definition of the terms which distinctly refer to persons who are noticeably above average intelligence, usually good at things in technically demanding fields, and socially awkward or alienated to a certain extent.\nGeek chic.\n\"Geek chic\" is a phrase that means a person who has stereotypically \"geek\" features including black-rimmed glasses, T-shirts with geek in-jokes, and more technically complex things.\nThere are many ways of looking at the term \"geek chic\", with heavy black-rimmed glasses being the one defining thing as far as the press is concerned. Wearing them is sufficiently notable to have celebrities like David Beckham, Justin Timberlake and Myleene Klass being reported as \"trying geek chic\". David Tennant, the Tenth Doctor in \"Doctor Who\", has also described the look of his bespectacled character as having \"a bit of geek chic\".\nGeeks themselves think that the term is used for \"reclaiming the geek identity as something not only meaningful, but also stylish.\" - for this usage, more than just glasses are needed, and so the term has a wider meaning, being applied to home fittings and objects as well as clothes. In this usage, the term \"geek chic\" can even be used as a positive contrast to the somewhat more negative term \"geeky\".\nGeek chic is not to be confused with preppie fashion, which is more widely to do with a conservative image rather than geek culture. Instead, much of the geek chic image borrows from various other youth fashions such as goth, hippie, and bohemian among others, but t-shirts with geeky in-jokes seem to originate from the geeks themselves. Shirt designers who tailor to geeks offer rewards for the best ideas.\nTrademark dispute.\nThe company of has trademarked \"Geek Squad\" as the name of its computer repair service. Best Buy has fought the trademarks of a dozen other companies, including Geek Rescue, Rent a Geek, and . It is also fighting with Newegg over the use of \"Take it from a Geek\" on Newegg's website. The NBC television show \"Chuck\" wanted to use \"Geek Squad\" to describe the main characters' job. But Best Buy asked for them to change the name. So the characters on \"Chuck\" were called \"Nerd Herd\" instead."}

The shots were fired in October and November 2010. Experts looked at the bullets left at the various places. They could see that all of the shots were from the same rifle.\nIncidents.\nThe first shooting was aimed at the National Museum of the Marine Corps in Triangle, Virginia on October 16, 2010. Some bullets from a high-velocity rifle went through the atrium skylight. The second shooting happened on October 19, 2010 shortly before 5 a.m. Someone shot at the south side of The Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia. The bullets broke windows on the third and fourth floors. Special glass stopped the bullets from entering the building. The offices behind those windows were empty because of repairs. The Pentagon Reservation was temporarily closed because the police searched the area for evidence. The building was reopened about 5:40 a.m. The Joint Terrorism Task Force is leading the investigation into the incident. In the third shooting, the same rifle shot the Marine Corps Museum again on October 29. The same rifle was used to attack a Marine Corps recruiting center in Chantilly, Virginia on October 26.\nThese attacks made the organizers of the October 31, 2010 Marine Corps Marathon upgrade the safety measures.

He is a 22 year old naturalized Ethiopian immigrant and Marine Corps Reserve Lance Corporal. He was found at Arlington National Cemetery while it was closed. He was carrying spent shell casings, a notebook containing references to the Taliban and Osama bin Laden, and plastic bags filled with ammonium nitrate, a common component of homemade explosives. He also left his car parked in the woods near the Pentagon, police said. He had also been recently charged with breaking into 27 cars in suburban Washington. The investigation of the incident connected Melaku to the shootings. On June 23, 2011, he was charged with two counts of willfully injuring the property of the United States. If he is convicted of those charges, he could go to prison for 20 years. Melaku is also charged with two counts of using a firearm during a violent crime. If he is convicted of those charges, he could go to prison for the rest of his life.

It is about the symmetry of molecules. It puts molecules into groups according to their symmetry. It can predict or explain many of a molecule's chemical properties.\nChemists study symmetry to explain how crystals are made up and how chemicals react. The molecular symmetry of the reactants help predict how the product of the reaction is made up and the energy needed for the reaction.\nMolecular symmetry can be studied several different ways. Group theory is the most popular idea. Group theory is also useful in studying the symmetry of molecular orbitals. This is used in the H\u00fcckel method, ligand field theory, and the Woodward\u2013Hoffmann rules. Another idea on a larger scale is the use of crystal systems to describe crystallographic symmetry in bulk materials.\nScientists find molecular symmetry by using X-ray crystallography and other forms of spectroscopy. Spectroscopic notation is based on facts taken from molecular symmetry.\nHistorical background.\nPhysicist Hans Bethe used characters of point group operations in his study of ligand field theory in 1929. Eugene Wigner used group theory to explain the selection rules of atomic spectroscopy. The first character tables were compiled by L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Tisza (1933), in connection to vibrational spectra. Robert Mulliken was the first to publish character tables in English (1933). E. Bright Wilson used them in 1934 to predict the symmetry of vibrational normal modes. The complete set of 32 crystallographic point groups was published in 1936 by Rosenthal and Murphy.\nSymmetry concepts.\nMathematical group theory has been adapted to study of symmetry in molecules. \nElements.\nThe symmetry of a molecule can be described by 5 types of symmetry elements. \nOperations.\nEach of the five symmetry elements has a symmetry operation. People use a caret symbol (^) to talk about the operation rather than the symmetry element. So, \u0108n is the rotation of a molecule around an axis and \u00ca is the identity operation. A symmetry element can have more than one symmetry operation associated with it. Since C1 is equivalent to E, S1 to \u03c3 and S2 to \"i\", all symmetry operations can be classified as either proper or improper rotations.\nPoint groups.\nA point group is a set of symmetry operations forming a mathematical \"group\", for which at least one \"point\" remains fixed under all operations of the group. A crystallographic point group is a point group which will work with translational symmetry in three dimensions. There are a total of 32 crystallographic point groups, 30 of which are relevant to chemistry. Scientists use Schoenflies notation to classify point groups.\nGroup theory.\nMathematics define a \"group\". A set of symmetry operations form a group when:\nThe order of a group is the number of symmetry operations for that group.\nFor example, the point group for the water molecule is C2v, with symmetry operations E, C2, \u03c3v and \u03c3v'. Its order is thus 4. Each operation is its own inverse. As an example of closure, a C2 rotation followed by a \u03c3v reflection is seen to be a \u03c3v' symmetry operation: \u03c3v*C2 = \u03c3v'. (Note that \"Operation A followed by B to form C\" is written BA = C).\nAnother example is the ammonia molecule, which is pyramidal and contains a three-fold rotation axis as well as three mirror planes at an angle of 120\u00b0 to each other. Each mirror plane contains an N-H bond and bisects the H-N-H bond angle opposite to that bond. Thus ammonia molecule belongs to the C3v point group which has order 6: an identity element E, two rotation operations C3 and C32, and three mirror reflections \u03c3v, \u03c3v' and \u03c3v\".\nCommon point groups.\nThe following table contains a list of point groups with representative molecules. The description of structure includes common shapes of molecules based on VSEPR theory.\nRepresentations.\nSymmetry operations can be written in many ways. A good way to write them is by using matrices. For any vector representing a point in Cartesian coordinates, left-multiplying it gives the new place of the point transformed by the symmetry operation. Composition of operations is done by matrix multiplication. In the C2v example this is:\nAlthough an infinite (going on forever) number of such representations (ways of showing things) exist, the irreducible representations (or \"irreps\") of the group are commonly used, as all other representations of the group can be described as a linear combination of the irreducible representations. (The irreps span the vector space of the symmetry operations.) Chemists use the irreps to sort the symmetry groups and to talk about their properties.\nCharacter tables.\nFor each point group, a character table summarizes information on its symmetry operations and on its irreducible representations. The tables are square because there are always equal numbers of irreducible representations and groups of symmetry operations.\nThe table itself is made of characters which show how a particular irreducible representation changes when a particular symmetry operation is applied (put to it). Any symmetry operation in a molecule's point group acting on the molecule itself will leave it unchanged. But for acting on a general entity (thing), such as a vector or an orbital, this does not have to be what happens. The vector could change sign or direction, and the orbital could change type. For simple point groups, the values are either 1 or -1: 1 means that the sign or phase (of the vector or orbital) is unchanged by the symmetry operation (\"symmetric\") and -1 denotes a sign change (\"asymmetric\").\nThe representations are labeled according to a set of conventions:\nThe tables also tell the Cartesian basis vectors, rotations about them, and quadratic functions of them transformed by the symmetry operations of the group. The table also shows which irreducible representation transforms in the same way (on the right hand side of the tables). Chemists use this because chemically important orbitals (in particular \"p\" and \"d\" orbitals) have the same symmetries as these entities.\nThe character table for the C2v symmetry point group is given below:\n \nFor example, water (H2O) which has the C2v symmetry described above. The 2\"p\"x orbital of oxygen is oriented perpendicular to the plane of the molecule and switches sign with a C2 and a \u03c3v'(yz) operation, but remains unchanged with the other two operations (obviously, the character for the identity operation is always +1). This orbital's character set is thus {1, -1, 1, -1}, corresponding to the B1 irreducible representation. Similarly, the 2\"p\"z orbital is seen to have the symmetry of the A1 irreducible representation, 2\"p\"y B2, and the 3\"d\"xy orbital A2. These assignments and others are in the rightmost two columns of the table."}

Paul Getty", "text": "Jean Paul Getty (December 15, 1892 \u2013 June 6, 1976) was an American industrialist. He founded the Getty Oil Company. In 1957 \"Fortune\" magazine named him the richest living American, and the 1966 Guinness Book of Records named him as the world's richest private citizen, worth an estimated $1,200 million. At his death, he was worth more than $2 billion. A book published in 1996 ranked him as the 67th richest American who ever lived. (The book ranked his wealth as a percentage of the United States gross national product.) Despite his wealth, Getty was known for being a miser.\nGetty enjoyed collecting art and antiquities. His collection formed the basis of the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles, California, and over $661 million of his estate was left to the museum after his death. He established the J. Paul Getty Trust in 1953. The trust is the world's wealthiest art institution. It operates the J. Paul Getty Museum, the Getty Foundation, the Getty Research Institute, and the Getty Conservation Institute.\nBiography.\nHis father George Getty owned a petroleum business in Minneapolis, Minnesota. J. Paul was one of the first people in the world with a fortune estimated at over one billion U.S. dollars.\nHe enrolled at the University of Southern California, then at University of California, Berkeley before graduating in 1914 from Magdalen College, Oxford with degrees in economics and political science. He spent his summers between studies working on his father's oil fields in Oklahoma. Running his own oil company in Tulsa, he made his first million by 1916. However, in 1917, he announced that he was retiring to become a Los Angeles-based playboy. Although he eventually returned to business, Getty had lost his father's respect. Just before George Franklin Getty died in 1930, he believed that Jean Paul would destroy the family company, and told him so.\nAfter taking a few years off from the money-making grind to enjoy spending his earnings on women, Getty returned to Oklahoma in 1919. During the 1920s he added about $3 million to his already sizable estate. His succession of marriages and divorces (three during the 1920s, five throughout his life) so distressed his father, however, that J. Paul inherited a mere $500,000 of the $10 million the senior Getty left at his death in 1930.\nGetty carefully invested his resources during the Great Depression. Getty acquired Pacific Western Oil Corporation. He began the acquisition (completed in 1953) of the Mission Corporation, which included Tidewater Oil and Skelly Oil. In 1967 the billionaire merged these holdings into Getty Oil.\nBeginning in 1949, Getty paid Ibn Saud $9.5 million in cash and $1 million a year for a 60-year concession to a tract of barren land near the border of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. No oil had ever been discovered there. After spending $30 million over four years, oil was discovered there. From 1953 onward, Getty's gamble produced a year, which contributed greatly to the fortune which made him one of the richest people in the world.\nGetty learned to speak Arabic which helped his unparalleled expansion into the Middle East. Getty owned the controlling interest in nearly 200 businesses, including Getty Oil. Associates identified his overall wealth at between $2 billion and $4 billion. It did not come easily, perhaps inspiring Getty's widely quoted remark\u2014\"The meek shall inherit the earth, but not the mineral rights.\"\nHe moved to England in the 1950s and loved English culture (Anglophile). He lived and worked at his 16th-century Tudor estate, Sutton Place near Guildford; the traditional country house became the centre of Getty Oil and his associated companies and he used the estate to entertain his British and Arabian friends (including the British Rothschild family and numerous rulers of Middle Eastern countries). Getty lived the rest of his life in the British Isles, dying of heart failure at the age of 83 on June 6, 1976.\nMarriages, divorces, and children.\nGetty was married and divorced five times. He had five sons with four of his wives:\nHe was quoted as saying \"A lasting relationship with a woman is only possible if you are a business failure\".\nSuccess as an autobiographical author.\nGetty wrote a very successful book entitled \"How to Be Rich\".\nCoin-box telephone.\nGetty famously had a pay phone installed at Sutton Place, helping to seal his reputation as a miser. In his autobiography, he described his reasons:\nGetty placed dial-locks on all the regular telephones, limiting their use to authorised staff, and the coin-box telephone was installed for others. When speaking in a televised interview with Alan Whicker, Getty said that he thought guests would want to use a payphone .\nGrandson's kidnapping.\nOn July 10, 1973 in Rome, 16 year old John Paul Getty III was kidnapped and a ransom of $17 million was demanded over the phone for his safe return. However, \"the family suspected a ploy by the rebellious teenager to extract money from his miserly grandfather.\" John Paul Getty II asked his father for the money, but was refused.\nIn November 1973 an envelope containing a lock of hair and a human ear was delivered to a daily newspaper. The second demand had been delayed three weeks by an Italian postal strike. The demand threatened that Paul would be further mutilated unless $3.2 million was paid: \"This is Paul\u2019s ear. If we don\u2019t get some money within 10 days, then the other ear will arrive. In other words, he will arrive in little bits.\"\nWhen the kidnappers finally reduced their demands to $3 million Getty senior agreed to pay no more than $2.2 million - the maximum that would be tax deductible. He loaned his son the remaining $800,000 at 4% interest. Paul III was found alive in southern Italy shortly after the ransom was paid. After his release Paul III called his grandfather to thank him for paying the ransom but Getty refused to come to the phone. Nine people were later arrested for the kidnapping, but only two were convicted. Paul III was permanently affected by the trauma and became a drug addict. After a stroke brought on by a cocktail of drugs and alcohol in 1981, Paul III was rendered speechless, nearly blind and partially paralyzed for the rest of his life. He died thirty years later on February 5, 2011 at the age of 54.\nGetty defended his initial refusal to pay the ransom on two points. First, he argued that to submit to the kidnappers' demands would immediately place his other fourteen grandchildren at the risk of copy-cat kidnappers. He added:\nThe 2017 movie \"All the Money in the World\" is based on these events. Christopher Plummer plays J. Paul Getty. In 2018, a television series based on the events, \"Trust\", premiered with Donald Sutherland playing Getty."}

He ruled Libya from 1969 to 2011.\nEarly life.\nMuammar al-Gaddafi was born in a tent near Qasr Abu Hadi. His family came from a small tribal group called Qadhadhfa. His family were Arabized Berber people in heritage. He joined the Libyan military in 1961; the military was one of the few ways for lower class Libyans like him to rise in social status. He became a colonel.\nRuler of Libya.\nGaddafi became head of state of Libya after removing King Idris from power in a 1969 bloodless coup. He ruled Libya from September 1, 1969 to August 23, 2011. After the coup, Gaddafi established the Libyan Arab Republic. He was one of the longest-serving non royal rulers in history, because he had ruled for more than 41 years. Gaddafi used Arab socialist and Arab nationalist ideas. He published a book about his philosophical views in 1975. This book is commonly known as \"The Green Book\". In 1977, he left the power of Libya, and continued playing role of revolutionary. People called him the \"Brother Leader and Guide of the Revolution\".\nThe Libyan Arab Republic was renamed to the Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya in 1977 later it was renamed again to the Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya by Gaddafi in 1986.\nIn the 1980s, he developed chemical weapons, because of it critics called Libya a pariah state. A Dutch investigation found that Gaddafi had built up a \"billion-dollar empire\", from assets in an international company in the oil industry. It also claims that his assets are scattered throughout much of Europe, Despite no trace or proof for even 1 billion have been found. Gaddafi had a strong interest in geo-political control, was a firm supporter of OAPEC and led a Pan-African campaign for a United States of Africa. In 1986 Libya was bombed by US, home of Gaddafi was targeted but he survived. Bombing was condemned by many nations and also by UN.\nIn 1988, the United Nations imposed economic sanctions on Libya. Gaddafi started to have closer economic and security relations with the West. He cooperated with investigations into alleged Libyan anti-western acts, by 1999 he offered to dismantle weapon of mass destruction of Libya, which would be inspected in 2003. As a result, the UN sanctions were lifted in the same year.\nGaddafi was elected Chairperson of the African Union in 2009.\n2011 Libyan protests.\nIn February 2011 there were major violent protests against Libyan government. These came alongside other demonstrations in Tunisia, Egypt, and other parts of the Arab world. The protests quickly turned into a civil war. Gaddafi vowed to \"die a martyr\" if necessary in his fight against rebels and external forces; he also said that \"peaceful protest is one thing but armed rebellion is another.\"\nAccusal of Crimes.\nOn 17 May 2011 the International Criminal Court issued a request for an arrest warrant against Gaddafi for alleged crimes against humanity, which was approved on 27 June and a warrant was issued by the court. On June 2011, according to investigation made by Amnesty International, it was found that there was no evidence for many of the alleged crimes, and that the rebels had falsely blamed Gaddafi as well as the government. He was accused of ordering the Lockerbie bombing in Scotland that killed over 200 people. The bombing targeted a civilian plane and it was downed.\nDeath.\nThe Libyan Civil War (2011) erupted in February. The aim was to remove Gaddafi from power. Gaddafi was captured alive and killed by NATO backed rebels in Sirte, Libya, on 20 October 2011. Sirte was the last stronghold of the Gaddafi regime."}

The reaction is electrocyclic if the result is one pi bond becoming one sigma bond or one sigma bond becoming a pi bond. Electrocyclic reactions share the following properties:\nThe torquoselectivity in an electrocyclic reaction refers to the direction that the substituents rotate. For example, the substituents in a reaction that is conrotatory can still rotate in two directions. It produces a mixture of two products that are the mirror image of each other (enantiomeric products). A reaction that is torquoselective restricts one of these directions of rotation (partially or completely) to produce a product in enantiomeric excess (where one stereoisomer is produced much more than the other).\nChemists are interested in electrocyclic reactions because the geometry of the molecules confirm a number of predictions made by theoretical chemists. They confirm the conservation of molecular orbital symmetry.\nThe Nazarov cyclization reaction is an electrocyclic reaction that closes a ring. It converts divinylketones to cyclopentenones. (It was discovered by Ivan Nikolaevich Nazarov (1906\u20131957).)\nAn example is the thermal ring-opening reaction of 3,4-dimethylcyclobutene. The cis isomer only yields \"cis,trans-2,4-hexadiene\". But the trans isomer gives the trans,trans diene:\nThe frontier-orbital method explains how this reaction works. The sigma bond in the reactant will open in a way that the resulting p-orbitals will have the same symmetry as the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the product (a butadiene). This can only happen with a conrotatory ring-opening that results in opposite signs for the two lobes at the broken ends of the ring. (A disrotatory ring-opening would form an anti-bond.) The following diagram shows this:\nThe stereospecificity of the result depends on whether the reaction proceeds through a conrotatory or disrotatory process.\nWoodward-Hoffman rules.\nThe Woodward\u2013Hoffmann rules address the conservation of orbital symmetry in electrocylic reactions.\nCorrelation diagrams connect the molecular orbitals of the reactant to those of the product having the same symmetry. Correlation diagrams can be drawn for the two processes.\nThese correlation diagrams indicate that only a conrotatory ring opening of 3,4-dimethylcyclobutene is \"symmetry allowed\" whereas only a disrotatory ring opening of 5,6-dimethylcyclohexa-1,3-diene is \"symmetry allowed\". This is because only in these cases would maximum orbital overlap occur in the transition state. Also, the formed product would be in a ground state rather than an excited state.\nFrontier molecular orbital theory.\nThe Frontier Molecular Orbital Theory predicts that the sigma bond in the ring will open in a way that the resulting p-orbitals will have the same symmetry as the HOMO of the product.\nThe above diagram shows two examples. For the 5,6-dimethylcyclohexa-1,3-diene (top row of diagram), only a disrotatory mode would result in p-orbitals having the same symmetry as the HOMO of hexatriene. The two p-orbitals rotate in opposite directions. For the 3,4-dimethylcyclobutene (bottom row of diagram), only a conrotatory mode would result in p-orbitals having the same symmetry as the HOMO of butadiene. The p-oribtals rotate in the same direction.\nExcited state electrocyclizations.\nLight can move an electron up to an excited state that occupies a higher orbital. The excited electron will occupy the LUMO, which has a higher energy level than the electron's old orbital. If light opens the ring of 3,4-dimethylcyclobutene, the resulting electrocyclization would be occur by a disrotatory mode instead of a conrotatory mode. The correlation diagram for the allowed excited state ring opening reaction shows why:\nOnly a disrotatory mode, in which symmetry about a reflection plane is maintained throughout the reaction, would result in maximum orbital overlap in the transition state. Also, once again, this would result in the formation of a product that is in an excited state of comparable stability to the excited state of the reactant compound.\nElectrocyclic reactions in biological systems.\nElectrocyclic reactions occur frequently in nature. One of the most common such reactions in nature is the biosynthesis of vitamin D3.\nThe first step involves light opening the ring of 7-dehydrocholesterol to form pre vitamin D3. This is a photochemically induced conrotatory electrocyclic reaction. The second step is a [1,7]-hydride shift to make vitamin D3.\nAnother example is in the proposed biosynthesis of aranotin, an oxepine found in nature, and its related compounds.\nPhenylalanine is used to make diketopiperazine (not shown). Then enzymes epoxidate diketopiperazine to make the arene oxide. This undergoes a 6\u03c0 disrotatory ring opening electrocyclization reaction to produce the uncyclized oxepine. After a second epoxidation of the ring, the nearby nucleophilic nitrogen attacks the electrophilic carbon, forming a five membered ring. The resulting ring system is a common ring system found in aranotin and its related compounds.\nThe benzonorcaradiene diterpenoid (A) was rearranged into the benzocycloheptatriene diterpenoid isosalvipuberlin (B) by boiling a methylene chloride solution. This transformation can be thought of as a disrotatory electrocyclic reaction, followed by two suprafacial 1,5-sigmatropic hydrogen shifts, as shown below:\nScope.\nAn example of an electrocyclic reaction is the conrotatory thermal ring-opening of benzocyclobutane. The reaction product is a very unstable ortho-quinodimethane. This molecule can be trapped in an endo addition with a strong dienophile such as maleic anhydride to the Diels-Alder adduct. The chemical yield for the ring opening of the benzocyclobutane depicted in \"scheme 2\" is found to depend on the nature of the substituent R. With a reaction solvent such as toluene and a reaction temperature of 110\u00a0\u00b0C, the yield increases going from methyl to isobutylmethyl to trimethylsilylmethyl. The increased reaction rate for the trimethylsilyl compound can be explained by silicon hyperconjugation as the \u03b2C-Si bond weakens the cyclobutane C-C bond by donating electrons. \nAn biomimetic electrocyclic cascade reaction was discovered in relation to the isolation and synthesis of certain endiandric acids: "}

{"id": "302732", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=302732", "title": "Robert Woodward", "text": "Robert Burns Woodward (April 10, 1917 \u2013 July 8, 1979) was an American organic chemist. He made many important discoveries in modern organic chemistry. He worked on the synthesis and structure of complex natural products. He worked closely with Roald Hoffmann on the theory of chemical reactions. Woodward won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for 1965.\nEarly life and education.\nWoodward was born in Boston, Massachusetts. When he was one year old, his father died in the influenza pandemic of 1918.\nHe was interested in chemistry at an early age. By the time he entered high school, he had already done most of the experiments in Ludwig Gattermann's textbook of experimental organic chemistry. In 1928, Woodward asked the Consul-General of the German consulate in Boston, to send him copies of a few original papers published in German journals. He was fascinated to read Otto Diels and Kurt Alder's original communication about the Diels\u2013Alder reaction. \nIn 1933, he entered the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), but did not do well enough to continue. MIT readmitted him in 1935, and by 1936 he had received the Bachelor of Science degree. Only one year later, MIT awarded him the doctorate. This was very unusual at the time, because most MIT students earned only a Bachelor of Science degree after four years. Woodward's studies were about the synthesis of the female sex hormone estrone, a natural type of estrogen. He held a Junior Fellowship at Harvard University from 1937 to 1938, and stayed at Harvard for the rest of his life. In the 1960s, Woodward was named Donner Professor of Science, a post which allowed him to spend all his time on research.\nEarly work.\nIn the early 1940s Wooward was using ultraviolet spectroscopy to discover the structure of natural products. Woodward collected a large amount of information, and then worked out a series of rules, later called the Woodward's rules. These rules could be used to find out the structures of new natural products, as well as non-natural synthesized molecules. Woodward was always quick to use newly developed techniques. Woodward's discovery saved chemists from spending a lot of time using chemical methods to work out the structures of compounds.\nIn 1944 Woodward and William von Eggers Doering reported the synthesis of the alkaloid quinine, used to treat malaria. The synthesis was a breakthrough, as quinine was hard to get from Japanese occupied southeast Asia. In fact, Woodward's method could not be used on a practical scale, but it was a landmark for chemical synthesis. Organic synthesis was still largely a matter of trial and error, and nobody thought such complex structures could actually be constructed. Woodward showed that organic synthesis could be made into a science. Woodward's synthesis of quinine was the first of many of his very complicated and elegant syntheses.\nLater work and its impact.\nBy the 1930s, the British chemists Christopher Ingold and Robert Robinson among others had studied the mechanisms of organic reactions. They had come up with rules which could predict reactivity of organic molecules. Woodward was probably the first synthetic organic chemist who used these rules to predict what steps would work in a synthesis. \nOrganic syntheses and Nobel Prize.\nDuring the late 1940s, Woodward synthesized many complex natural products including quinine, cholesterol, cortisone, strychnine, lysergic acid, reserpine, chlorophyll, cephalosporin, and colchicine. With these, Woodward opened up a new era of synthesis, sometimes called the 'Woodwardian era'. He showed that natural products could be synthesized by careful applications of the principles of physical organic chemistry, and by very careful planning.\nMany of Woodward's syntheses were described as spectacular by his colleagues. Before he did them, some people thought it would be impossible to create these substances in the lab. Woodward's syntheses were also described as having an element of art in them, and since then, synthetic chemists have always looked for elegance as well as utility in synthesis. His work also involved the exhaustive use of the then newly developed techniques of infrared spectroscopy and later, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Another important feature of Woodward's syntheses was their attention to stereochemistry or the particular configuration of molecules in three dimensional space. Most natural products of medicinal importance are effective, for example as drugs, only when they possess a specific stereochemistry. This creates the demand for 'stereospecific synthesis', producing a compound with a defined stereochemistry. Woodward was a pioneer in showing how one could conduct reactions that were stereospecific. Many of his syntheses involved forcing a molecule into a certain configuration by installing rigid structural elements in it, another tactic that has become standard today. In this regard, especially his syntheses of reserpine and strychnine were landmarks.\nDuring World War II, Woodward was an advisor to the War Production Board on the penicillin project. \nWoodward also applied the technique of infrared spectroscopy and chemical degradation to determine the structures of complicated molecules. Notable among these structure determinations were santonic acid, strychnine, magnamycin and terramycin. About terramycin, Woodward's colleague and Nobel Laureate Derek Barton said:\n\"The most brilliant analysis ever done on a structural puzzle was surely the solution (1953) of the terramycin problem. It was a problem of great industrial importance, and hence many able chemists had performed an enormous amount of work trying to determine the structure. There seemed to be too much data to resolve the problem, because a significant number of observations, although experimentally correct, were very misleading. Woodward took a large piece of cardboard, wrote on it all the facts and, by thought alone, deduced the correct structure for terramycin. Nobody else could have done that at the time.\"\nIn each one of these cases, Woodward again showed how rational facts and chemical principles, combined with chemical intuition, could be used to achieve the task.\nIn the early 1950s, Woodward, and British chemist Geoffrey Wilkinson, proposed a structure for ferrocene, a compound consisting of a combination of an organic molecule with iron. This marked the beginning of the field of transition metal organometallic chemistry. The field later grew which grew to be important to the chemical industry. Wilkinson won the Nobel Prize for this work in 1973, with Ernst Otto Fischer. Some historians think that Woodward should have shared this prize along with Wilkinson. Woodward himself thought so, and voiced his thoughts in a letter sent to the Nobel Committee.\nWoodward won the Nobel Prize in 1965 for his synthesis of complex organic molecules. In his Nobel lecture, he described the total synthesis of the antibiotic cephalosporin, and claimed that he had pushed the synthesis schedule so that it would be completed around the time of the Nobel ceremony.\nB12 synthesis and Woodward-Hoffmann rules.\nIn the early 1960s, Woodward began work on what was the most complex natural product synthesized to date- vitamin B12. In a remarkable collaboration with his colleague Albert Eschenmoser in Zurich, a team of almost one hundred students and postdoctoral workers worked for many years on the synthesis of this molecule. The work was finally published in 1973, and it marked a landmark in the history of organic chemistry. The synthesis included almost a hundred steps, and involved the rigorous planning and analyses that had always characterised Woodward's work. This work, more than any other, convinced organic chemists that the synthesis of any complex substance was possible, given enough time and planning. However, as of 2006, no other total synthesis of Vitamin B12 has been published.\nThat same year, based on observations that Woodward had made during the B12 synthesis, he and Roald Hoffmann devised rules (now called the Woodward\u2013Hoffmann rules) for elucidating the stereochemistry of the products of organic reactions. Woodward based his ideas on his experiences as a synthetic organic chemist; he asked Hoffman to perform theoretical calculations to verify the ideas. This was done using Hoffmann's Extended H\u00fcckel method. The predictions of these rules were verified by many experiments. Hoffmann shared the 1981 Nobel Prize for this work along with Kenichi Fukui, a Japanese chemist who had done similar work using a different approach. Woodward had died two years before and so was not eligible to share this Prize.\nA recent paper in the journal \"Nature\" describes how mechanical stress can be used to reshape chemical reaction pathways to lead to products that apparently violate Woodward\u2013Hoffman rules.\nWoodward Institute and later life.\nWhile at Harvard, Woodward took on the directorship of the \nWoodward Research Institute, based at Basel, Switzerland in 1963. He also became a trustee of his alma mater, MIT, from 1966 to 1971, and of the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel.\nWoodward died in Cambridge, Massachusetts from a heart attack in his sleep. At the time, he was working on the synthesis of an antibiotic, erythromycin. A student of his said:\n\"I owe a lot to Woodward. He showed me that one could attack difficult problems without a clear idea of their outcome, but with confidence that intelligence and effort would solve them. He showed me the beauty of modern organic chemistry, and the relevance to the field of detailed careful reasoning. He showed me that one does not need to specialize. Woodward made great contributions to the strategy of synthesis, to the deduction of difficult structures, to the invention of new chemistry, and to theoretical aspects as well. He taught his students by example the satisfaction that comes from total immersion in our science. I treasure the memory of my association with this remarkable chemist.\"\nPublications.\nDuring his lifetime, Woodward authored or coauthored almost 200 publications, of which 85 are full papers. The remainder comprising preliminary communications, the text of lectures, and reviews. The pace of his scientific activity soon outstripped his capacity to publish all experimental details, and much of the work in which he participated was not published until a few years after his death. Woodward trained more than two hundred Ph.D. students and postdoctoral workers, many of whom later went on to distinguished careers. \nIdiosyncracies.\nHis lectures were legendary and frequently used to last for three or four hours. [His longest known lecture defined the unit of time known as the \"Woodward\", and thereafter his other lectures were deemed to be so many \"milli-Woodwards\" long!] In many of these, he eschewed the use of slides and used to draw beautiful structures by using multicolored chalk. As a result, it was always easy to take good notes at a Woodward lecture. Typically, to begin a lecture, Woodward would arrive and lay out two large white handkerchiefs on the countertop. Upon one would be four or five colors of chalk (new pieces), neatly sorted by color, in a long row. Upon the other handkerchief would be placed an equally impressive row of cigarettes. The previous cigarette would be used to light the next one. His famous Thursday seminars at Harvard often lasted well into the night. He had a fixation with blue, and all his suits, his car, and even his parking space were coloured in blue. In one of his laboratories, his students hung a large black and white photograph of the master from the ceiling, complete with a large blue \"tie\" appended. There it hung for some years (early 1970s), until scorched in a minor laboratory fire. He detested exercise, could get along with only a few hours of sleep every night, was a heavy smoker, and enjoyed Scotch whisky and a martini or two. Hoffmann would correspond with Woodward using blue paper."}

They were designed by Yisrael Galil and Yaacov Lior in the late 1960s. They were made by Israel Military Industries Ltd (now Israel Weapon Industries Ltd) of Ramat HaSharon.\nHistory.\nThe Galil's design is supposed to make it work well in warm weather. It was designed from the Finnish RK 62. The RK 62 itself was designed from the Soviet AK-47 assault rifle. It was chosen as the winner of a competition for the Israel Defense Forces. This competition included many other designs. Some of these were the M16A1, Stoner 63, AK-47 and HK33. The Galil was officially brought into service in 1972. It replaced the FN FAL.\nDesign.\nFeatures.\nThe Galil is fired by a small hammer. It has a trigger mechanism which was designed from the trigger used in the American M1 Garand. The rifle's fire has three positions: \"R\" (First letter of \"repeating\", which is a British word for semi-automatic fire); the middle position, \"A\", gives fully automatic fire; and pushing the lever fully forward turns on the safety so that the weapon can not be fired.\nThe weapon is made with a plastic hand guard and pistol grip. The rifle can be used with a sound suppressor. A suppressor makes the weapon quieter. The weapon has a bottle opener and wire cutter built into the bipod. The bottle opener was built in to stop damage to magazines. This was because the magazines were being used to open bottles. Wire cutters were built in to reduce the time that IDF troops took to cut down wire fences. This is because there are many wire fences in rural areas of Israel.\nBarrel.\nThe barrel has a flash suppressor. It can be used to launch rifle grenades or attach a bayonet. It is possible to attach the M7 bayonet to the Galil.\nFeeding.\nThe Galil gets its ammunition from a curved, steel box magazine. It can hold 35 rounds. There is a special colour-coded 12-round magazine which is used for blanks. The magazine is put into the gun in a similar way to the AK group. A special attachment can allow the Galil to use STANAG magazines.\nTypes of Galil.\nAR.\nThe AR is the normal rifle version. It has a plastic handguard. The handguard can take a lot of damage before breaking. The stock of the AR can fold (to the right side).\nSAR.\nThe SAR carbine type of the AR has a shorter barrel (332\u00a0mm, 13.07in). Because the barrel is shorter, the mechanisms inside the barrel are also smaller.\nARM.\nThe ARM version is a light machine gun. It has a handle to carry the weapon, a bipod which folds and a larger handguard. The handguard is made from wood. The wooden handguard stays cool when the weapon is being fired fully automatically. The bipod can be used as a wire cutter. The back of the handguard can be used to open bottles. This was put in to stop soldiers opening bottles with the magazines, as this damaged them.\nMAR.\nMAR stands for Micro Galil. It is a smaller version of the SAR. It weighs 2.98\u00a0kg without a magazine. The MAR gets its ammunition from a 35-round magazine. Two of these can be attached to make reloading quicker. The MAR has the same rate of fire (630-750 rounds per minute) as other 5.56\u00a0mm Galil models. An optional magazine adapter inserted inside the magazine well allows the use of standard 20 and 30-round M16 magazines. The MAR has four settings: \"S\"\u2014weapon can not fire, \"A\"\u2014automatic fire, \"B\"\u20143-round burst, \"R\"\u2014semi-automatic fire. The MAR can have many different sights attached to it. The MAR can also be given with plastic magazines (instead of steel magazines). These weigh 0.164\u00a0kg. They can also be given with more space around the trigger so that soldiers wearing gloves can fire it.\nOther types.\nSome other types of Galil are:"}

He was a national leader in urban education reform. He lost his re-election bid in the 2010 Democratic primary to Vincent C. Gray, who went on to win the general election for mayor.\nEarly life, education, and family.\nFenty grew up in the Mount Pleasant neighborhood of Washington, D.C. and graduated from Mackin Catholic High School. As a teenager, he worked at Swenson's Ice Cream next to the Uptown Theatre.\nFenty's mother is white, and his father is African-American. Adrian Fenty is the middle child of three boys\u2014older brother Shawn, a bicycle expert, and younger brother Jess. Their parents are runners and own a Fleet Feet athletic shoe store in the D.C. neighborhood of Adams Morgan. Adrian has run in the Cherry Blossom Ten Mile Run each year since 2004, improving his finishing time from 1:17:22 in 2005 to 1:02:59 in 2009.\nFenty earned a B.A. in English and Economics at Oberlin College and a J.D. from the Howard University School of Law. He is a member of Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity.\nIn 1997, Fenty and lawyer Michelle Cross eloped. Michelle Cross Fenty works for the Inter-American Development Bank. They have three children: twins Matthew and Andrew (b. 2000) and Aerin Alexandra (b. 2008).\nEntry into politics and service on D.C. Council.\nFenty was an intern for Senator Howard Metzenbaum (D-OH), Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-DC), and Representative Joseph P. Kennedy II (D-MA) before becoming involved in local politics. In addition to serving as an aide to Councilmember Kevin P. Chavous, he was elected as an Advisory Neighborhood Commissioner in ANC 4C and was president of the 16th Street Neighborhood Civic Association.\nIn 2000, Fenty won a seat on the D.C. Council. Fenty ran against long-time Ward 4 Councilmember Charlene Drew Jarvis. Jarvis was well known and a heavy favorite, but Fenty campaigned hard. He pursued an aggressive door-to-door strategy and put up large numbers of green yard signs. Fenty was elected to the Council seat by a 57\u201343 percent margin. Unopposed in both the primary and general elections in 2004, Fenty was reelected for a second term.\nAs a Council member, Fenty worked on constituent services. He opposed public funding for a new baseball stadium. He proposed funding a $1 billion capital improvement program for public schools, which the Council subsequently passed in an altered form. He is a member of the Mayors Against Illegal Guns Coalition, an organization formed in 2006 and co-chaired by New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg and Boston mayor Thomas Menino.\nWhile major, Fenty used three BlackBerry devices. One BlackBerry directly connected him to Police Chief Cathy Lanier while the latter two were for business and personal matters.\n2006 Mayoral Campaign.\nFenty formally announced his decision to campaign for mayor of the District of Columbia on June 1, 2005. In the fall of 2005, then-mayor Anthony A. Williams made the widely anticipated announcement that he would not seek re-election, and then-Council Chair Linda Cropp announced she would be a candidate for Mayor. Other candidates included businesswoman Marie Johns, then-Council member Vincent Orange, and lobbyist Michael A. Brown. Brown dropped out of the race in September 2006.\nFenty ran on a platform of bringing a more energetic and hands-on approach to district government. Cropp trumpeted her 25 years of experience in district government and her desire to continue the progress made by Anthony Williams, who endorsed her candidacy. The race was widely viewed as neck-and-neck through the spring of 2006. Both candidates raised significant and nearly equal amounts of money\u00a0\u2013roughly $1.75 million through June 10, 2006\u00a0\u2013and neither gained any significant advantage from the numerous debates and forums.\nBy July 2006, public and private polling gave Fenty a roughly 10-point advantage. Political observers have debated whether it was Fenty's unprecedented door-to-door campaign, in which he and his campaign workers visited virtually every block in the district, Cropp's lack of engagement in the campaign, or the electorate's desire for a new direction after eight years of Anthony Williams. Cropp's campaign began a series of negative attacks during the last month of the campaign. In direct mail and television advertisements, Cropp painted Fenty as unfit for the job and a careless lawyer who had been admonished by the D.C. Bar; in 2005, he received an informal admonition from the Bar Association for his role in a probate case in 1999. The attacks, however, backfired; the reaction, coupled with the endorsement of the \"Washington Post\" newspaper, increased Fenty's lead in the campaign's final weeks.\nOn September 12, 2006, Fenty won all 142 district precincts in the Democratic Primary. This had never happened before in District of Columbia history\u2014and defeated Linda Cropp by a 57\u201331 percent margin.\nFenty received 89% of the vote in the general election. He became the district's sixth elected mayor since the establishment of home rule.\nTenure (2007\u201311).\nFenty paid a lot of attention to education reform. On the first day of his term, in an unprecedented and controversial move, Fenty introduced legislation to restructure the school system to give him full responsibility for schools. Across the district, district residents had been demanding that the schools be \"fixed.\" Schools in the district had been troubled for years with student test performance scores and graduation rates among the lowest in the nation. In 1996, a Control Board appointed by Congress had taken over control of the public school system, declaring that the schools were in a \"state of emergency.\" Mayor Fenty viewed this re-structuring as the solution.\nIn April, 2007, the D.C. Council approved Fenty's school takeover plan, and in May 2007, legislation needed to approve the change was passed by Congress and signed by President Bush. Under the new structure, the existing superintendent was replaced by a school chief, or chancellor, who was selected by the mayor and would report directly to him. This power shift also allowed the mayor to make swift changes in the system's central office, alter teacher qualification requirements, and implement a school consolidation process. His selection of Michelle Rhee to manage District schools surprised many people. In choosing Rhee, he stepped outside of the local landscape to consult with national education experts including New York City School Chancellor Joel Klein.\nThe move to restructure the school's reporting system and the addition of a school chancellor as a direct report have been credited with putting the school system on the path to long-awaited improvements. To ensure that maximum resources would go directly to classrooms, the mayor and chancellor closed 23 underenrolled schools and significantly reduced the school system's central administrative staff. \nStudent achievement at the secondary level rose 14 points in reading and 17 points in math since 2007, gains that are unprecedented in DC history and unparalleled nationwide. Student SAT scores rose 27 points in 2010. Graduation rates rose each year since 2007, and 72 percent of district students took the Practice Scholastic Aptitude Test, a.k.a. the PSAT, which functions as a practice test for students entering college. His administration also took on a major, five-year maintenance and construction effort to dramatically improve school buildings by 2014. The Mayor and Chancellor successfully negotiated a collective bargaining agreement with the Washington Teachers Union. The contract has become a national model for other jurisdictions, especially because it establishes a system of performance-based teacher compensation.\nWhile focusing on improving schools, the Fenty Administration changed district agencies, ensuring more efficient and effective service delivery throughout district government. Fenty's choice for police chief, Cathy Lanier, also made national headlines. Under Fenty, Lanier has added police officers to the streets and expanded community policing initiatives, for example, \"beefing up\" the policy of accepting anonymous text message tips from local residents to cut down on retaliation. By local news accounts, there is evidence of success. The homicide rate in the District dropped 25% in 2009. The closure rate for homicide cases rose to 70%. In his \"State of the District\" speech, the Mayor reported that homicides were at their \"lowest level since 1964\" and that \"both violent crimes and property crimes\" had experienced a double-digit decline.\nFenty has championed development efforts across the district. Across the district, several schools, libraries, parks and recreation centers have been renovated to offer state-of-the-art facilities for residents, youth and families. There have been many improvements made to recreational play spaces for children: Under Fenty, 16 neighborhood and school playgrounds were opened and 9 play courts and fields were completed. Under his leadership, the District's largest shopping center, the D.C. USA Shopping Center, was opened. New developments, such as the Camp Simms retail development, have infused new life into the neighborhood with a retail grocery store and a sit-down restaurant east of the Anacostia River. Renovation of affordable housing units helped provide housing during tough economic times.\nThe Fenty Administration also expanded health care coverage for the uninsured and established thousands of units of affordable housing, while creating the \"Housing First\" program to provide permanent supportive housing for the district's homeless. The administration also reduced the backlog of Child Protective Services (CPS) investigations by improving the retention of social workers, increasing recruitment of social workers to fill vacancies, and building a quality, experienced leadership. Additionally, the Fenty Administration improved the delivery of emergency medical services. It also finalized the sale of Greater Southeast Community Hospital (now United Medical Center) in a public-private partnership that kept the facility open for patients east of the Anacostia River.\nIn December 2009, Fenty signed the Religious Freedom and Civil Marriage Equality Act of 2009 to legalize same-sex marriage in the District of Columbia. During the signing ceremony, Mayor Fenty and other attending district officials expressed their support for the gay rights movement by expressing \"they want the District to provide a road map for gay rights activists as the debate over same-sex marriage...moves across the nation...\"\nControversies.\nMayor Fenty and his administration came under attack from political opponents. Council Chair Gray complained that Fenty did not share with the district council tickets donated by a local sports arena. Chair Gray demanded that Fenty hand the tickets over to him so Gray could have control of them.\nThe D.C. council also charged that Fenty circumvented them in making contracts for park improvements. Rather than treat them as district contracts, the contracts were made with the D.C. Housing Agency.\nUnsuccessful 2010 re-election campaign.\nFenty officially launched his reelection bid on April 10, 2010, at his campaign headquarters at 5929 Georgia Avenue, NW, in Washington, D.C.\u2019s Brightwood neighborhood. The Fenty campaign's headquarters were located on the site of the old Curtis Chevrolet dealership within Ward 4, the ward in which Fenty began his political career as an Advisory Neighborhood Commissioner in ANC 4C.\nFenty faced ten candidates in the District's September 14, 2010, Democratic primary. On July 31, 2009 (13\u00bd months before the 2010 primary), Fenty's 2010 mayoral campaign passed the 2006 primary fundraising total of $2.4 million.\nOn August 1, 2010, the editorial board of \"The Washington Post\" officially endorsed Fenty. \"Washington City Paper\" followed on September 9.\nOne primary candidate in particular, Sulaimon Brown devoted his efforts to attacking Fenty rather than establishing his own positive campaign. After the election, Brown was given a $110,000 per year job in the D.C. Department of Health Care Finance within the new administration. However, Brown was later fired because of questions about his past. In March 2011, Congress announced an investigation into the hiring of Brown.\nA \"Washington Post\" poll released on Aug. 29 found Gray with a 17-point lead among likely voters. A Clarus poll conducted September 7 gave Gray a 7-point lead among likely voters, and a Public Policy Polling survey sponsored by WAMU-FM radio and \"Washington City Paper\" showed an 11 percent lead for Gray.\nFenty lost the Democratic primary election to Vincent C. Gray. Gray received 53 percent of the vote to Fenty's 46 percent. Following the reporting of the results, Fenty called it highly unlikely he would run for public office again. \nWhile Fenty received the most write-in votes for mayor in the Republican primary election, Fenty had previously said he would not accept the Republican nomination.\nAfter politics.\nFenty signed with Greater Talent Network, a major speakers bureau, in January 2011. The same month, Fenty became an outside adviser and counsel to Heffler, Radetich &amp; Saitta, an accounting and consulting firm based in Philadelphia. Also in January 2011, it was announced that Fenty would become a distinguished visiting professor of politics, a featured lecturer and a career adviser in the Department of African American Studies at Oberlin College. In February 2011, Fenty became an outside adviser to Rosetta Stone, which produces foreign language learning software. In March 2011, Fenty became a strategic adviser for the state and local government practice of Capgemini Government Solutions LLC, an information technology consulting firm. In May 2011, Fenty became a member of the advisory board of EverFi Inc., an online education and certification firm. In July 2011, Fenty joined the law firm Klores Perry Mitchell P.C. as special counsel.\nOn the \"Morning Joe\" broadcast on March 8, 2011, Adrian Fenty backed Wisconsin Republican Governor Scott Walker's union-busting bill and said that the Democratic state senators should be held accountable.\nElection history.\n2000 Council of the District of Columbia, Ward 4, Democratic Primary Election\n2000 Council of the District of Columbia, Ward 4, General Election\n2004 Council of the District of Columbia, Ward 4, Democratic Primary Election\n2004 Council of the District of Columbia, Ward 4, General Election\n2006 Mayor of the District of Columbia, Democratic Primary Election\n2006 Mayor of the District of Columbia, General Election"}

He was a candidate for mayor of the District of Columbia in 2010. During the campaign, he actively supported another candidate, Vincent Gray. After Gray became mayor, Brown's criminal record became public. He is being investigated by the United States Attorney. Brown is also being investigated by committees of the DC City Council and of Congress.\nBackground.\nBrown's father, Melvin Brown, was an Army Ranger, and Brown's mother was a nurse at Howard University Hospital.\nBrown earned a Bachelor of Business Administration - Accounting from the University of the District of Columbia. Brown worked as a University of the District of Columbia police officer until 2005. Brown then worked at various accounting firms. In 1988, Brown was tried and acquitted by a jury on an attempted murder charge in Chicago. Brown was also accused of assault in Essex County, New Jersey, but a grand jury refused to indict Brown. The \"Washington City Paper\" reported that DC court records show \"gun charges against Brown were dropped in 1991 in exchange for Brown going to a diversion program, and a jury found Brown guilty in 1995 for unlawful entry.\" The \"City Paper\" also reported that a restraining order had been issued against Brown in 2007. The press asked Brown if he had a criminal record. Brown replied that he had been arrested once for trespassing at Howard University.\nPolitical activity.\nBrown was a volunteer in Adrian Fenty's 2006 campaign for mayor. According to Brown's 2009 website, Brown \"worked behind the scenes campaigning for many elected officials [including] The President of the United States Barack Obama. He has helped in efforts to get White House Legislation passed and most recently trying to get a Supreme Court nominee appointed.\" Brown became a candidate for the 2010 Democratic Party nomination for mayor.\nOn June 24, 2010, Brown was running out of money because he had not held a job for 18 months. Brown discussed his financial problems with another candidate for mayor, Vincent Gray. Brown and Gray reached an agreement for Gray to provide cash payments to Brown for the rest of the campaign. They also agreed that if Gray won the election, the city would hire both Brown and his brother. Before the primary election, Brown received $44,000 from the Gray campaign and an additional $750 from Lorraine Green, Chairwoman of Gray's campaign. Howard Brooks carried the cash between Gray's campaign and Brown.\nBecause Brown was a declared candidate, he participated with Mayor Fenty in a number of candidate debates. At the August 2010 forum in Ward 8, Brown questioned whether Fenty loved his parents. According to the \"Washington Post\", \"During the election, Brown, 40, drew attention at debates by urging voters to cast ballots for Gray and criticizing incumbent Adrian M. Fenty.\" Brown received 209 votes in the primary. Gray defeated Fenty in the September 14, 2010 primary, and Gray won the general election in November 2010. Gray became Mayor in January 2011.\nPolitical appointment.\nThe Gray Transition Team hired the Capitol Inquiry firm to check Brown's background. Capitol Inquiry discovered Brown's past legal proceedings in Chicago and New Jersey, and included them in a confidential report.\nIn January 2011, Brown was hired to a $110,000-a-year job in the DC Office of Health Care Finance. Gray claimed that Brown was hired by Wayne Turnage, the director of that office. When the \"Washington City Paper\" raised questions about the hiring of Brown, he was quickly fired. DC police escorted Brown out of his new office. Mayor Gray called a press conference the same day, and stated:\nHe\u2019s qualified to do the work, Mark. What he did on the campaign has no relation to this. What he did on the campaign is what he decided to do. I didn't ask him to do that nor did I encourage him to do that.Turnage said that he fired Brown because they could not get along and not because of what was printed about his background. Brown sat in the back of the press conference as an uninvited guest, and spoke to reporters at the end of the conference. When the press asked Brown if Gray had promised him a job, Brown refused to answer. Brown blamed City Councilman David Catania for his being fired. Brown said that Catania had threatened to delay the confirmation of Turnage until Brown was fired. Catania denied this.\nBrown was placed on paid administrative leave for 15 days.\nInvestigations.\nIn March 2011, Congress announced an investigation into the hiring of Brown.\nIn April and May 2011, the DC City Council issued a subpeona to get Brown to testify. Brown hid from the people trying to give him the subpeona and went to court to fight having to testify. On May 31, 2011, the D.C. Superior Court order Brown to testify before the D.C. Council committee that was investigating this matter. On June 6, 2011, Brown testified under oath that Gray had paid him cash to keep in as a candidate in the primary race and had promised him a job. Brown claimed that Gray himself had ordered one of the payoffs. The City Council probe showed that Green, Gray's chief of staff Gerri Mason Hall and Gray's personnel director Judy Banks gave Gray's political allies city jobs. They did it in a way that did not pay attention to qualifications or laws.\nBrown was required to report the money that he got as campaign contributions. On June 5, Brown gave the press copies of money orders payable to \"Sulaimon Brown for Mayor\" from relatives of Howard Brooks, including Brook's son (Peyton Brooks), the son's girlfriend, and a cousin of Brook's wife. The last two denied ever making the contributions. Peyton Brooks was also hired as a $110,000-a-year special assistant in the Office of the Deputy Mayor for Planning and Economic Development. Peyton Brooks was one of several children of Gray's campaign workers to be fired after the press printed stories about the jobs. Brown said that he received additional money orders from Howard Brooks, but that those did not have names on them.\nThe United States Attorney's Office is also investigating. Brown said that the Federal Bureau of Investigation asked Brown about the payments from Brooks, Green and Gray."}

The first attack was a car bombing near government buildings in Oslo. The second attack was a mass shooting at a summer youth camp on an island northwest of Oslo. Of the total 77 deaths, 55 were teenagers, and another 96 people were injured. The car bomb also shattered many windows of buildings in the government quarter of downtown Oslo.\nThe bomb explosion was near the office of Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg at 15:26. It killed eight people and injured several others. The second attack happened about 90 minutes later, at a youth camp organized by the youth group (AUF) of the Norwegian Labour Party (AP) at the island of Ut\u00f8ya in Tyrifjorden, Buskerud. A gunman disguised as a policeman opened fire at the campers, killing 69 people.\nThe police arrested several suspects, but most were released. Anders Behring Breivik, a 32-year-old Norwegian Protestant man, committed both attacks. He was later charged with both attacks. Records show he had planned the attacks for years, as an act of anti-immigration ideology and against multiculturalism.\nThe European Union, NATO and countries around the world have expressed their support for Norway and condemned the attacks.\nOslo bombing.\nOn 22 July 2011 at 15:26 (CEST) a powerful explosion went off near the offices of the Prime Minister of Norway (\"H-blokka\") and several other government buildings, such as the Ministry of Petroleum and Energy (\"R4\") and Ministry of Finance. \"(See map)\"\nThe nearby street was filled with glass and debris following the explosion. The wreckage of a car was sighted near one of the affected buildings. A giant cloud of white smoke was seen as a fire burned at the Ministry of Petroleum. The blast was heard at least seven kilometres away.\nFollowing the explosion, police cleared the area and searched for more explosive devices. The police asked people to leave central Oslo.\nCasualties.\nEight people are known to have been killed in the explosion, with fifteen injured, eleven seriously. A doctor at the Oslo University Hospital said the hospital staff were treating head, chest and abdominal injuries.\nPrime Minister Jens Stoltenberg was not hurt in the blast. Norway\u2019s finance minister, Sigbj\u00f8rn Johnsen, was on holiday in Denmark at the time.\nBecause July is the main holiday time in Norway, and that attacks took place during the weekend, there were not as many people in the area as usual, which may saved many lives.\nImpact on transportation.\nAll roads into Oslo's downtown area were closed as police moved people from the area and warned Oslo residents to stay away from the city center. They were also told to limit their usage of mobile phones due to concerns of another possible terrorist attack. Public transport into and out of the city was stopped. The police checked cars on the road to Oslo airport, which remained open as the police conducted searches in cars at the site.\nThe Gardermoen railway line between Lillestr\u00f8m and Oslo airport was shut down after a suspicious package was found close to the tracks. The same happened at the offices of TV 2, which were evacuated after a suspicious package was found outside the building.\nUt\u00f8ya shooting.\nAbout 90 minutes after the Oslo explosion, a gunman in police uniform, believed to be Anders Behring Breivik, got on a ferry about 40 kilometres (25\u00a0miles) northwest of Oslo. The ferry went to the island of Ut\u00f8ya in lake Tyrifjorden. The island was the site of the Labour Party's annual Workers' Youth League (AUF) youth summer camp. Once on the island, the gunman began to shoot the mainly adolescent campers, before finally being captured.\nThe shooter was dressed as a police officer, and said he had come over for a routine check following the bombing event in Oslo. He signalled and asked people to gather around him before firing his weapons, killing and injuring many people. He first shot people on the island and later started shooting at people who were trying to escape by swimming across the lake. The police reported that most of the casualties were youths of about 15 and 16 years old. People on the island were reported to have hidden in lavatories or undergrowth, communicating by text message to avoid giving their positions away to the gunman.\nThe shooting supposedly lasted for 90 minutes. The police were informed about the shooting at 17:27, and at 18:27 the gunman had been arrested. When the police arrived at the scene, they were confronted with a scene of survivors begging the officers to throw away their weapons. They were afraid that the men in uniforms would again open fire on them.\nAt about 03:50 (CEST) on 23 July 2011, the National Police Commissioner \u00d8ystein M\u00e6land thought the number of deaths at Ut\u00f8ya was \"at least 80\" with the count expected to increase. Sixty-nine people died.\nPerpetrator.\nThe attacker is Anders Behring Breivik. He was arrested on Ut\u00f8ya for the shootings and also linked to the Oslo bombings. He has been charged and convicted of carrying out both attacks. He is in prison.\nPolitical views.\nActing national police chief Sveinung Sponheim said that the suspected gunman's Internet postings \"suggest that he has some political traits directed toward the right, and anti-Muslim views, but whether that was a motivation for the actual act remains to be seen\". Police have described Breivik as being a right-wing extremist. Breivik described himself as a conservative nationalist. He has been described as a Christian fundamentalist by news sources. He is reported to have written many posts on the website \"document.no\", described by \"Aftenposten\" as \"Islam-critical and Israel-friendly\". He went to meetings of \"Documents venner\" (Friends of Document), linked with the website. He is was also once a member of the right-wing Progress Party (FrP) and its youth wing FpU. FpU leader Ove Vanebo said Breivik was active early in the 2000s, but he left the party as his viewpoints became more extreme.\nMedia reports say that Breivik posted comments on the internet saying he is an admirer of Winston Churchill and Max Manus, and also of Dutch politician Geert Wilders. Breivik said Wilders' Party for Freedom, is \"the only true party for conservatives\". Breivik has said he is \"pro-gay and pro-Israel\". On Twitter he paraphrased utilitarian philosopher John Stuart Mill: \"One person with a belief is equal to the force of 100,000 who have only interests.\" The Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation (NRK) said that Breivik published a 1516-page manifesto, on his anti-multiculturalist and right-wing militant ideologies, on the day of the attacks.\nBeliefs that there were other perpetrator(s).\nSeveral witnesses at the youth camp, believe (as of 23 July 2011) that there was more than one shooter. The police have received descriptions of a second gunman, and are currently checking this information. Due to the uncertainty surrounding these witness descriptions and the chaotic nature of the events the police have, as a matter of precaution, yet to make an official comment on the matter. Acting Police Chief Sveinung Sponheim has said that \"It's very difficult at this point to say whether he was acting alone or whether he was acting as part of a larger network\".\nReactions.\nDomestic.\nAt a press conference on the morning after the attacks, prime minister Jens Stoltenberg called the attack a \"national tragedy\" and the worst atrocity since World War II. Stoltenberg said that the attack would not hurt the Norwegian democracy, and said the proper answer to the violence was \"more democracy, more openness, but not naivety\".\nEskil Pedersen of the Workers' Youth League vowed to \"return to Ut\u00f8ya\" and urged Norway to continue its tradition of openness and tolerance.\nKing Harald sent his condolences to the victims and their families, and urged unity.\nSvein \u00d8sterud , professor emeritus, said that before we can analyze the trauma of the nation, we have to acknowledge that Breivik and [some] other terrorists, are youths that lost their way, when going thru institutions ... while struggling to find one's identity, and at the same time (and everyday) being forced to [ conform to the] norms set by school, parents, and social media.\nInternational.\nThe European Union, NATO, the United Nations Security Council, governments and leaders from around the world expressed their condemnation of the attack, condolences, and solidarity with Norway.\nMemorials.\nAt Ut\u00f8ya, the place of memorial is called [\"the clearing\"] \"Lysninga\"; a part of it is [\"the ring\"] \"Ringen\" - a \"ring of steel [that] hangs between trees and here the names and age of the majority of those 69 killed are engraved\"; \"it lies at the highest point of the island\"; It was unveiled during the summer of 2015. \"Hegnhuset\" was inaugurated in 2016.\nA temporary national monument in Oslo was unveiled on 22 July 2016. \nOne monolith stands in each municipality.\nAt 53 [places] in Norway, are statues by Nico Widerberg that were anonymously financed.\nOne monolith was put at Utsikten - a roadside rest area with a view of Ut\u00f8ya; it is located on E16 at Nes in Hole (municipality).\nNational memorial in Hole municipality.\nIn June 2017 the government decided that one of the national memorials, should be placed at Ut\u00f8ya-kaia, in Hole municipality; the memorial will not [be a work of art, or] have an artistic expression. KORO , an agency under the Ministry of Culture, will no longer formally be tied to the process in regard to the memorial in Hole.\nIn popular culture.\nJan Kj\u00e6rstad published in 2017, \"Berge\", a novel that is about the attacks and a triple homicide in 1999, in Norway ."}

He tried unsuccessfully to marry a young girl, and then was accused of stealing money from his employer. He moved to London and gave himself the title of Count Strzelecki. In 1834 he went to North America and spent time visiting mineral areas and exploring for minerals. He is said to be the first person to find copper in Canada. In 1836 he travelled along the west coast from Chile to California.\nIn 1839 he visited the Hawaii, Tahiti, New Zealand and finally landed in Sydney, Australia. He wanted to make a geological map, and explored large parts of New South Wales and Victoria, including the Australian Alps. He climbed Australia's highest mountain, and named it Mount Kosciuszko, after the Polish leader, Tadeusz Kosciuszko.\nHe spent several years in Tasmania before going back to Sydney. He went back to London in 1843. He wrote a book on his discoveries in Australia called \"Physical Description of New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land\". He was given the Founder's Medal by the Royal Geographical Society.\nIn 1847\u20148 he was put in charge of the giving out money in Ireland during the Great Famine for the British Relief Association.

These internal forces are a reaction to the external forces applied on the body that cause it to separate, compress or slide. External forces are either surface forces or body forces. Stress is the average force per unit area that a particle of a body exerts on an adjacent particle, across an imaginary surface that separates them.\nThe formula for uniaxial normal stress is:\nwhere \u03c3 is the stress, F is the force and A is the surface area.\nIn SI units, force is measured in newtons and area in square metres. This means stress is newtons per square meter, or N/m2. However, stress has its own SI unit, called the pascal. 1 pascal (symbol Pa) is equal to 1 N/m2. In Imperial units, stress is measured in pound-force per square inch, which is often shortened to \"psi\". The dimension of stress is the same as that of pressure.\nIn continuum mechanics, the loaded deformable body behaves as a continuum. So, these internal forces are distributed continually within the volume of the material body. (This means that the stress distribution in the body is expressed as a piecewise continuous function of space and time.) The forces cause deformation of the body's shape. The deformation can lead to a permanent shape change or structural failure if the material is not strong enough.\nSome models of continuum mechanics treat force as something that can change. Other models look at the deformation of matter and solid bodies, because the characteristics of matter and solids are three dimensional. Each approach can give different results. Classical models of continuum mechanics assume an average force and do not properly include \"geometrical factors\". (The geometry of the body can be important to how stress is shared out and how energy builds up during the application of the external force.)\nSimple stresses.\nIn some situations, the stress within an object can be described by a single number, or by a single vector (a number and a direction). Three such simple stress situations are the \"uniaxial normal stress\", the \"simple shear stress\", and the \"isotropic normal stress\".\nUniaxial normal stress.\nTensile stress (or tension) is the stress state leading to expansion; that is, the length of a material tends to increase in the tensile direction. The volume of the material stays constant. When equal and opposite forces are applied on a body, then the stress due to this force is called tensile stress.\nTherefore in a uniaxial material the length increases in the tensile stress direction and the other two directions will decrease in size. In the uniaxial manner of tension, tensile stress is induced by pulling forces. Tensile stress is the opposite of compressive stress.\nStructural members in direct tension are ropes, soil anchors and nails, bolts, etc. Beams subjected to bending moments may include tensile stress as well as compressive stress and/or shear stress.\nTensile stress may be increased until the reach of tensile strength, namely the \"limit state\" of stress.\nStress in one-dimensional bodies.\nAll real objects occupy three-dimensional space. However, if two dimensions are very large or very small compared to the others, the object may be modelled as one-dimensional. This simplifies the mathematical modelling of the object. One-dimensional objects include a piece of wire loaded at the ends and viewed from the side, and a metal sheet loaded on the face and viewed up close and through the cross section."}

It is a pericyclic chemical reaction where \"two or more unsaturated molecules (or parts of the same molecule) combine with the formation of a cyclic adduct in which there is a net reduction of the bond multiplicity.\" It is a cyclization reaction: it makes new ring of atoms.\nCycloadditions are named by the basic size of the molecules that are being brought together. This would make the Diels\u2013Alder reaction a [4 + 2]cycloaddition, and the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition a [3 + 2]cycloaddition. This type of reaction is a non-polar addition reaction.\nReaction mechanism.\nHeat can cause the double bonds to form a ring. Thermal cycloadditions usually have (4n + 2) \u03c0 electrons participating in the starting material, for some whole number \"n\". Because of orbital symmetry, most cycloadditions are suprafacial-suprafacial. Rarely, they are antarafacial-antarafacial. There are a few examples of thermal cycloadditions which have 4n \u03c0 electrons (for example the [2 + 2] cycloaddition). These proceed in a suprafacial-antarafacial sense. For example, the dimerisation of ketene has a orthogonal set of p orbitals. Those p orbitals allow the reaction to proceed using a crossed transition state.\nLight can also cause the double bonds to form a ring. Cycloadditions in which 4n \u03c0 electrons participate can also occur as a result of photochemical activation. Here, one component makes an electron move from the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) (\u03c0 bonding) to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) (\u03c0* antibonding). After the electron is promoted to the higher orbital, orbital symmetry allows the reaction to proceed in a suprafacial-suprafacial manner. An example is the DeMayo reaction. Another example is shown below, the photochemical dimerization of cinnamic acid.\nNote that not all photochemical (2+2) cyclizations are cycloadditions; some are known to operate by radical mechanisms.\nSome cycloadditions instead of \u03c0 bonds operate through strained cyclopropane rings; as these have significant \u03c0 character. For example, an analog for the Diels\u2013Alder reaction is the quadricyclane-DMAD reaction: \nIn the (i+j+...) cycloaddition notation i and j refer to the number of atoms involved in the cycloaddition. In this notation a Diels-Alder reaction is a (4+2)cycloaddition and a 1,3-dipolar addition such as the first step in ozonolysis is a (3+2)cycloaddition. This notation uses parenthesis. The IUPAC preferred notation however, with [i+j+...] counts electrons and not atoms. It uses square brackets. In this notation, the Diels\u2013Alder reaction and the dipolar reaction both become a [4+2]cycloaddition. The reaction between norbornadiene and an activated alkyne is a [2+2+2]cycloaddition.\nTypes of cycloaddition.\nDiels-Alder reactions.\nThe Diels\u2013Alder reaction is a [4+2]cycloaddition reaction.\nHuisgen cycloadditions.\nThe Huisgen cycloaddition reaction is a [2+3]cycloaddition.\nNitrone-olefin cycloaddition.\nThe Nitrone-olefin cycloaddition is a [3+2]cycloaddition.\nFormal cycloadditions.\nCycloadditions often have metal-catalyzed and stepwise radical analogs, however these are not strictly speaking pericyclic reactions. When charged or radical intermediates are involved in a cycloaddition, or when the cycloaddition result is found in a series of reaction steps, they are sometimes called formal cycloadditions to make a difference from true pericyclic cycloadditions. \nOne example of a formal [3+3]cycloaddition between a cyclic enone and an enamine catalyzed by \"n\"-butyllithium is a Stork enamine / 1,2-addition cascade reaction:"}

A pericyclic reaction is one that involves a transition state with a cyclic array of atoms and an associated cyclic array of interacting orbitals. A reorganization of \u03c3 and \u03c0 bonds occurs in this cyclic array.\nCheletropic reactions are a subclass of cycloadditions. What sets cheletropic reactions apart is that on one of the reagents, both new bonds are being made to the same atom. A few examples are shown to the right in Figure 1. In the first case, the single atom is the carbon atom in the carbonyl group. That carbon atom ends up in carbon monoxide. The end result is making two new bonds to one atom. The first two examples are known as \"cheletropic extrusions\" because a small stable molecule is given off in the reaction. The driving force for these reactions is often the entropic benefit of releasing a gas (e.g. CO or N2).\nTheoretical analysis.\nBecause of the geometry of the molecules involved in cheletropic reactions, they confirm a number of predictions made by theoretical chemists. Cheletropic reactions confirm the conservation of molecular orbital symmetry.\nIn the pericyclic transition state, a small molecule donates two electrons to the ring. Two possible geometries can explain the reaction. The small molecule can approach in either a linear or non-linear way. In the linear approach, the electrons in the orbital of the small molecule are pointed directly at the \u03c0 system of the big molecule. In the non-linear approach, the orbital approaches at a slightly off angle. The \u03c0-systems ability to rotate as the small molecule approaches is crucial in forming new bonds. The direction of rotation will be different depending on how many \u03c0-electrons are in the system. A diagram of a two-electron fragment approaching a four-electron \u03c0-system using frontier molecular orbitals is shown below. The rotation will be disrotatory if the small molecule approaches linearly and conrotatory if the molecule approaches non-linearly. Disrotatory and conrotatory tell how the bonds in the \u03c0-system are rotating. Disrotatory means opposite directions while conrotatory means the same direction. This is also shown in the diagram below.\nUsing Huckel's Rule, one can tell if the \u03c0-system is aromatic or anti-aromatic. If aromatic, linear approaches use disrotatory motion while non-linear approaches use conrotatory motion. The opposite goes with an anti-aromatic system. Linear approaches will have conrotatory motion while non-linear approaches will have disrotatory motion.\nCheletropic Reactions Involving SO2.\nThermodynamics.\nWhen sulfur dioxide reacts with butadiene and isoprene, two different products result. The reaction mechanism will control what gets made. A kinetic product and a thermodynamic product are both possible. More of the thermodynamic product gets made than the kinetic product. The kinetic product comes from a Diels\u2013Alder reaction, while a cheletropic reaction makes a more thermodynamically stable product. The cheletropic pathway is used more because it makes to a more stable five-membered ring adduct. The scheme below shows the difference between the two products. The path to the left shows the thermodynamic product, while the path to the right shows the kinetic product. Suarez and Sordo showed this in 1995. They showed this both with experiments and using Gaussian calculations.\nKinetics.\nOne example of this is the cheletropic reactions of 1,3-dienes with sulfur dioxide. Chemists have carefully looked at the kinetics of this reaction. In 1976, Isaacs and Laila measured the kenetic factors for the addition of sulfur dioxide to butadiene derivatives. Rates of addition were monitored in benzene at 30 \u00b0C with an initial twentyfold excess of diene. They used a spectrophotometer to study light at 320\u00a0nm to measure the disappearance of SO2. The reaction showed \"pseudo first-order kinetics\". The chemists found that electron-withdrawing groups on the diene decreased the rate of reaction. Also, the reaction rate was affected considerably by steric effects of 2-substituents, with more bulky groups increasing the rate of reaction. (In other words, the larger the group of atoms hanging from the second carbon atom, the quicker the reaction ran.) The authors attribute this to the tendency of bulky groups to favor the cisoid conformation of the diene which is essential to the reaction (see table below). In addition, the rates at four temperatures were measured for seven of the dienes. From these measurements, chemists used the Arrhenius equation to calculate the enthalpy of activation (\u0394H\u2021) and entropy of activation (\u0394S\u2021) for each reaction. This was one of the first important efforts to study the kenetics of a cheletropic reaction. \nMonnat, Vogel, and Sordo, in 2002, measured the kinetics of addition of sulfur dioxide to 1,2-dimethylidenecycloalkanes. They wrote that the reaction of 1,2-dimethylidenecyclohexane with sulfur dioxide can give two different products depending on reaction conditions. The reaction makes the corresponding sultine through a hetero-Diels-Alder reaction under kinetic control (\u2264 -60 \u00b0C), but, under thermodynamic control (\u2265 -40 \u00b0C), the reaction makes the corresponding sulfolene through a cheletropic reaction. The activation enthalpy for the hetero-Diels-Alder reaction is about 2 kcal/mol smaller than that for the corresponding cheletropic reaction. The sulfolene is about 10 kcal/mol more stable than the isometric sultine in CH2Cl2/SO2 solution.\nThe authors were able to experimentally work out a rate law at 261.2 K for the reaction of 1,2-dimethylidenecyclohexane with sulfur dioxide to give the corresponding sulfolene. The reaction was first order in 1,2-dimethylidenecyclohexane but second order in sulfur dioxide (see below). This confirmed a prediction of theoretical chemists based on high-level \"ab initio\" quantum calculations. Using computational methods, the authors proposed a transition structure for the cheletropic reaction of 1,2-dimethylidenecyclohexane with sulfur dioxide (see figure at right). The reaction is second order in sulfur dioxide because another molecule of sulfur dioxide likely binds to the transition state to help stabilize it. Similar results were found in an 1995 study by Suarez, Sordo, and Sordo which used \"ab initio\" calculations to study the kinetic and thermodynamic control of the reaction of sulfur dioxide with 1,3-dienes.\nSolvent effects.\nThe effect of the solvent of the cheletropic reaction of 3,4-dimethyl-2,5-dihydrothiophen-1,1-dioxide (shown at right) was kinetically investigated in 14 solvents. The reaction rate constants of the forward and reverse reaction in addition to the equilibrium constants were found to be linearly correlated with the ET(30) solvent polarity scale. \nReactions were done at 120 \u00b0C and were studied by 1H-NMR spectroscopy of the reaction mixture. The forward rate k1 was found to decrease by a factor of 4.5 going from cyclohexane to methanol. The reverse rate k-1 was found to increase by a factor of 53 going from cyclohexane to methanol, while the equilibrium constant Keq decreased by a factor of 140. It is suggested that there is a change of the polarity during the activation process as evidenced by relationships between the equilibrium and kinetic data. The authors say that the reaction appears to be influenced by the polarity of the solvent, and this can be shown by the change in the dipole moments when going from reactant to transition state to product. The authors also state that the cheletropic reaction doesn\u2019t seem to be influenced by either solvent acidity or basicity. \nThe results of this study lead the authors to expect the following behaviors: \n1. The change in the solvent polarity will influence the rate less than the equilibrium.\n2. The rate constants will be characterized by opposite effect on the polarity: k1 will slightly decrease with the increase of ET(30), and k-1 will increase under the same conditions.\n3. The effect on k-1 will be larger than on k1.\nCarbene Additions to Alkenes.\nOne of the most synthetically important cheletropic reactions is the addition of a singlet carbene to an alkene to make a cyclopropane (see figure at left). A carbene is a neutral molecule containing a divalent carbon with six electrons in its valence shell. Because of this, carbenes are highly reactive electrophiles and generated as reaction intermediates. A singlet carbene contains an empty \"p\" orbital and a roughly \"sp\"\"2\" hybrid orbital that has two electrons. Singlet carbenes add stereospecifically to alkenes, and alkene stereochemistry is retained in the cyclopropane product. The mechanism for addition of a carbene to an alkene is a concerted [2+1] cycloaddition (see figure). Carbenes derived from chloroform or bromoform can be used to add CX2 to an alkene to give a dihalocyclopropane, while the Simmons-Smith reagent adds CH2.\nInteraction of the filled carbene orbital with the alkene \u03c0 system creates a four-electron system and favors a non-linear approach. It is also favorable to mix the carbene empty \"p\" orbital with the filled alkene \u03c0 orbital. Favorable mixing occurs through a non-linear approach (see figure 2 at right). However, while theory clearly favors a non-linear approach, there are no obvious experimental implications for a linear vs. non-linear approach."}

{"id": "302818", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=302818", "title": "Sigmatropic reaction", "text": "A sigmatropic reaction in organic chemistry is a pericyclic reaction. A sigmatropic reaction does not use a catalyst and involves a single molecule (an uncatalyzed intramolecular process). It changes one \u03c3-bond into a different \u03c3-bond. The name \"sigmatropic\" is the result of a compounding of the long-established \"sigma\" name for single carbon-carbon bonds and the Greek word \"tropos\", meaning turn. This is a rearrangement reaction which means that the bonds in a molecule shift between atoms without any atoms leaving or new atoms added to the molecule. In a sigmatropic reaction, a substituent moves from one part of a \u03c0-bonded system to another part in an intramolecular reaction with simultaneous rearrangement of the \u03c0 system. True sigmatropic reactions usually do not need a catalyst. Some sigmatropic reactions are catalyzed by a Lewis acid. Sigmatropic reactions often have transition-metal catalysts that form intermediates in analogous reactions. The most well-known of the sigmatropic rearrangements are the [3,3] Cope rearrangement, Claisen rearrangement, Carroll rearrangement and the Fischer indole synthesis.\nOverview of Sigmatropic Shifts.\nWoodward-Hoffman Sigmatropic Shift Nomenclature.\nA special notation is used to describe sigmatropic shifts. Each of the carbon atoms on the backbone of the molecule are assigned a position number. Sigmatropic rearrangements are described by an order term [i,j]. This means the migration of a \u03c3-bond adjacent to one or more \u03c0 systems to a new position (i-1) and (j-1) atoms removed from the original location of the \u03c3-bond. When the sum of i and j is an even number, this is an indication of the involvement of a neutral, all C atom chain. An odd number suggests that there is a charged C atom or of a heteroatom lone pair replacing a carbon-carbon double bond. Thus, [1,5] and [3,3] shifts become [1,4] and [2,3] shifts with heteroatoms, while preserving symmetry considerations. Hydrogens are omitted in the third example for clarity.\nHere is a way to find the order of a given sigmatropic rearrangement. The first step is to give numbers to each atom starting with the atoms of the bond being broken as atom 1. Chemists count the atoms in each direction from the broken bond to the atoms that form the new \u03c3-bond in the product. The numbers that correspond to the atoms forming the new bond are then separated by a comma and placed within brackets. This creates the sigmatropic reaction order descriptor.\nChemists also count atoms when naming a sigmatropic shift where a hydrogen atom moves. The carbon chain does not break in a hydrogen atom migration. So, chemists count across all atoms involved in the reaction rather than only across the closest atoms. For example, the following hydrogen atom migration is of order [1,5], attained by counting counterclockwise through the \u03c0 system, rather than the [1,3] order through the ring CH2 group that would mistakenly result if counted clockwise.\nSuprafacial and Antarafacial Shifts.\nChemists have studied sigmatropic reactions where the migrating group has a sterocenter. In principle, all sigmatropic shifts can occur with either the same (retention) or the opposite (inversion) geometry of the migrating group. This depends on whether the original bonding lobe of the migrating atom or its other lobe is used to form the new bond.\nIn cases of stereochemical retention, the migrating group translates without rotation into the bonding position. In the case of stereochemical inversion the migrating group both rotates and translates to reach its bonded conformation.\nThere is another way that a sigmatropic reaction can produce products with different sterochemistry. The migrating group can stay on the original face of the \u03c0 system after rebonding. Or, it can go to the opposite face of the \u03c0 system. If the migrating group remains on the same face of the \u03c0 system, the shift is known as suprafacial. If the migrating group transfers to the opposite face is called an antarafacial shift. Transformations that occur within small- or medium-sized rings cannot make antarafacial shifts.\nClasses of Sigmatropic Rearrangements.\n[1,3] Shifts.\nThermal Hydride Shifts.\nIn a thermal [1,3] hydride shift, a hydride moves three atoms. The Woodward-Hoffmann rules dictate that it would proceed in an antarafacial shift. Although such a shift is symmetry allowed, the Mobius topology required in the transition state prohibits such a shift. It is geometrically impossible. This is why enols do not isomerize without an acid or base catalyst.\nThermal Alkyl Shifts.\nThermal alkyl [1,3] shifts, similar to [1,3] hydride shifts, must proceed antarafacially. The geometry of the transition state is prohibitive. But an alkyl group, due to the nature of its orbitals, can invert its geometry and form a new bond with the back lobe of its sp3 orbital. This reaction will result a suprafacial shift. These reactions are still not common in open chain systems because of the highly ordered nature of the transition state. So, the reactions work better in cyclic molecules.\nPhotochemical [1,3] Shifts.\nPhotochemical [1,3] shifts should be suprafacial shifts; however, most are non-concerted because they proceed through a triplet state (that is, they have a diradical mechanism, to which the Woodward-Hoffmann rules do not apply).\n[1,5] Shifts.\nA [1,5] shift involves the shift of 1 substituent (-H, -R or -Ar) down 5 atoms of a \u03c0 system. Hydrogen has been shown to shift in both cyclic and open chain systems at temperatures at or above 200 \u02daC. These reactions are predicted to proceed suprafacially, by a Huckel-topology transition state.\nPhotoirradiation would require an antarafacial shift of hydrogen. Although such reactions are rare, there are examples where antarafacial shifts are favored:\n \nIn contrast to hydrogen [1,5] shifts, there have never been any observed [1,5] alky shifts in an open-chain system. Chemists have determined rate preferences for [1,5] alkyl shifts in cyclic systems: carbonyl and carboxyl&gt; hydride&gt; phenyl and vinyl\u00bb alkyl.\nAlkyl groups undergo [1,5] shifts very poorly and usually require high temperatures. However, for cyclohexadienes, the temperature for alkyl shifts is not much higher than that for carbonyls, the best migratory group. A study showed that this is because alkyl shifts on cyclohexadienes proceed through a different mechanism. First the ring opens, followed by a [1,7] shift, and then the ring reforms electrocyclically:\nThis same mechanistic process is seen below, without the final electrocyclic ring-closing reaction, in the interconversion of lumisterol to vitamin D2.\n[1,7] Shifts.\n[1,7] sigmatropic shifts are predicted by the Woodward-Hoffmann rules to proceed in an antarafacial fashion, by a Mobius topology transition state. An antarafacial [1,7] shift is observed in the conversion of lumisterol to vitamin D2, where following an electrocyclic ring opening to previtamin D2, a methyl hydrogen shifts.\nBicyclic nonatrienes also undergo [1,7] shifts in a so called walk rearrangement, which is the shift of divalent group, as part of a three-membered ring, in a bicyclic molecule.\n[3,3] Shifts.\n[3,3] sigmatropic shifts are well studied sigmatropic rearrangements. The Woodward-Hoffman rules predict that these six electron reactions would proceed suprafacially, using a Huckel topology transition state.\nClaisen Rearrangement.\nDiscovered in 1912 by Rainer Ludwig Claisen, the Claisen rearrangement is the first recorded example of a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement. This rearrangement is a useful carbon-carbon bond-forming reaction. An example of Claisen rearrangement is the [3,3] rearrangement of an allyl vinyl ether, which upon heating yields a \u03b3,\u03b4-unsaturated carbonyl. The formation of a carbonyl group makes this reaction, unlike other sigmatropic rearrangements, inherently irreversible.\nAromatic Claisen rearrangement.\nThe ortho-Claisen rearrangement involves the [3,3] shift of an allyl phenyl ether to an intermediate which quickly tautomerizes to an ortho-substituted phenol.\nWhen both the ortho positions on the benzene ring are blocked, a second ortho-Claisen rearrangement will occur. This para-Claisen rearrangement ends with the tautomerization to a tri-substituted phenol.\nCope Rearrangement.\nThe Cope rearrangement is an extensively studied organic reaction involving the [3,3] sigmatropic rearrangement of 1,5-dienes. It was developed by Arthur C. Cope. For example 3,4-dimethyl-1,5-hexadiene heated to 300\u00a0\u00b0C yields 2,6-octadiene.\nOxy-Cope rearrangement.\nThe Oxy-Cope rearrangement a hydroxyl group is added at C3 forming an enal or enone after Keto-enol tautomerism of the intermediate enol:\nCarroll Rearrangement.\nThe Carroll rearrangement is a rearrangement reaction in organic chemistry and involves the transformation of a \u03b2-keto allyl ester into a \u03b1-allyl-\u03b2-ketocarboxylic acid. This organic reaction can be followed by decarboxylation and the final product is a \u03b3,\u03b4-allylketone. The Carroll rearrangement is an adaptation of the Claisen rearrangement and effectively a decarboxylative allylation.\nFischer Indole Synthesis.\nThe Fischer indole synthesis is a chemical reaction that produces the aromatic heterocycle indole from a (substituted) phenylhydrazine and an aldehyde or ketone under acidic conditions. The reaction was discovered in 1883 by Hermann Emil Fischer.\nThe choice of acid catalyst is very important. Successful acid catalysts include: Bronsted acids such as HCl, H2SO4, polyphosphoric acid and p-toluenesulfonic acid. Lewis acids such as boron trifluoride, zinc chloride, iron chloride, and aluminium chloride are also useful catalysts.\nSeveral reviews have been published.\n[5,5] Shifts.\nSimilar to [3,3] shifts, the Woodward-Hoffman rules predict that [5,5] sigmatropic shifts would proceed suprafacially, Huckel topology transition state. These reactions are rarer than [3,3] sigmatropic shifts, but this is mainly a function of the fact that molecules that can undergo [5,5] shifts are rarer than molecules that can undergo [3,3] shifts.\nWalk Rearrangements.\nThe migration of a divalent group, such as O, S, NR or CR2, which is part of a three-membered ring in a bicyclic molecule, is commonly referred to as a walk rearrangement. This can be formally characterized according to the Woodward-Hofmann rules as being a (1, n) sigmatropic shift. An example of such a rearrangement is the shift of substituents on tropilidenes (1,3,5-cycloheptatrienes). When heated, the pi-system goes through an electrocyclic ring closing to form bicycle[4,1,0]heptadiene (norcaradiene). Thereafter follows a [1,5] alkyl shift and an electrocyclic ring opening.\nProceeding through a [1,5] shift, the walk rearrangement of norcaradienes is expected to proceed suprafacially with a retention of stereochemistry. Experimental observations, however, show that the 1,5-shifts of norcaradienes proceed antarafacially. Theoretical calculations found the [1,5] shift to be a diradical process, but without involving any diradical minima on the potential energy surface."}

She was also the seventh U.S. Navy ship to use the name. She was launched in 1936 and was a \"Yorktown\" class aircraft carrier. She was one of three American carriers brought into service before World War II which survived the war. She took part in more fights against Japan than any other U.S. ship. These fights included the Battle of Midway, the Battle of the Eastern Solomons, the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands, many other fights during the Guadalcanal campaign, the Battle of the Philippine Sea, and the Battle of Leyte Gulf. At three different times during the Pacific War, the Japanese said that she had been sunk in battle. This lead her to be nicknamed \"The Grey Ghost\".\n\"Enterprise\" earned 20 battle stars. This was more than any other U.S. warship in World War II. Some have said that she is the most glorious and honored ship in the history of the United States Navy. However, the 18th century frigate USS Constitution could perhaps rival that.\nBuilding and commissioning.\n\"Enterprise\" was launched on 3 October 1936 at Newport News Shipbuilding. She was sponsored by Lulie Swanson, who was the wife of the Secretary of the Navy Claude A. Swanson. \"Enterprise\" was commissioned on 12 May 1938. \"Enterprise\" sailed south so that her performance could be tested. This took her to Rio de Janeiro. After she returned, she was used along the east coast and in the Caribbean until April 1939. This is when she was ordered to serve in the Pacific.\nService history.\n\"Enterprise\" was one of fourteen ships to be fitted with the RCA CXAM-1 RADAR. She was first based in San Diego (where she was used in the movie \"Dive Bomber\") and then at Pearl Harbor after President Roosevelt ordered the Fleet to be based far forward. \"Enterprise\" and the aircraft squads she carries trained a lot and moved aircraft among the island bases of the Pacific. \"Enterprise\" left Pearl Harbor on 28 November 1941. \"Enterprise\" was completing a transport mission, returning to Hawaii after moving Marine Fighter Squadron 211 (VMF-211) to Wake Island on 7 December 1941. This was when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor.\nWorld War II.\nPearl Harbor.\n\"Enterprise\" was returning to Oahu on the morning of 7 December 1941. 18 SBD Dauntlesses from \"Enterprise\" squadrons Scouting Squadron Six (VS-6) and Bombing Squadron Six (VB-6) arrived at Pearl Harbor while the Japanese were attacking it. Even though they were surprised, they quickly went into action to defend Pearl Harbor. VS-6 lost six planes during the attack. VB-6 lost one. Many of these planes were shot down by the Japanese. However, at least one plane was lost to anti-aircraft (AA) fire, and many more were damaged. During the battle, one radio report was heard: \"Do not attack me, this is Six Baker Three an American plane\". Later, the same pilot (Ensign Manuel Gonzales from VB-6) was heard telling his radioman/gunner to get ready to land on the water. Lieutenant C. E. Dickinson and his crewmate William C. Miller, from VS-6, shot down one Japanese plane before they had to jump out after their plane caught fire. Dickinson later went to Ford Island to fly another plane. He took part when the United States were searching for the Japanese fleet. \n\"Enterprise\" also sent up six F4F Wildcats from Fighting Squadron Six (VF-6) during the attack. All of these aircraft except two were shot down by shellshocked AA gunners when they tried to land on Ford Island later that night. \"Enterprise\" got her aircraft ready to go on a large search for the Japanese force that attacked Pearl Harbor. They search was to the south and west of Oahu. However, the Japanese had started moving northwest. \"Enterprise\" went into Pearl Harbor for fuel and supplies on the night of 8 December. Early the next morning, she went to patrol the rest of the Hawaiian Islands to make sure there were no more attacks. Even though the group did not find any ships, \"Enterprise\" aircraft sank Japanese submarine . \"I-70\" was sunk at on 10 December 1941.\nDuring the last two weeks of December 1941, \"Enterprise\" and her group moved to the west of Hawaii to make sure those islands were not attacked. Two other groups tried to help at Wake Island at the same time. After the \"Enterprise\" group had a short rest at Pearl Harbor, they left on 11 January. They were protecting ships sending help to Samoa. On 1 February, \"Enterprise\"'s Task Force 8 raided Kwajalein, Wotje, and Maloelap in the Marshall Islands. They sank three ships, damaged eight and destroyed many aircraft.\nThe Battle of Midway.\nFive days later, \"Enterprise\" sailed for the South Pacific to help other U.S. carriers in the Coral Sea. However, the Battle of the Coral Sea was over before \"Enterprise\" got there. \nOn 28 May, \"Enterprise\" moved, as Rear Admiral Raymond A. Spruance's flagship, to Midway. She was ordered to hold Midway and do as much damage to the enemy as possible. USS \"Hornet\", six cruisers and 10 destroyers were with \"Enterprise\" on that day. \nBoth the Americans and Japanese launched air attacks. Even though the fighting went on until 7 June, by the end of 4 June the result had been decided. The Battle of Midway began on the morning of 4 June 1942, when four Japanese carriers attacked on Midway Island. The Japanese did not know that the U.S. Navy was in the area. Just three hours after the first bomb hit Midway, planes from the U.S. carriers attacked. \"Enterprise\" launched an attack using torpedo bombers, but this failed. Soon after this, \"Enterprise\" dive bombers attacked and sank the Japanese carriers and . Later in the afternoon, bombers from \"Enterprise\" and USS \"Yorktown\" sank (aircraft from \"Yorktown\" also sank ). \"Yorktown\" and USS \"Hammann\" were the only American ships sunk, but 113 planes were lost. 61 of these were lost during the attacks. Japanese losses were much bigger. They lost four carriers, one cruiser and 272 planes. Even though she lost many planes, \"Enterprise\" returned to Pearl Harbor on 13 June 1942 undamaged.\nSouth Pacific.\nAfter a month of rest, \"Enterprise\" headed on 15 July 1942 for the South Pacific. There, she helped support the attack on the Solomon Islands on 8 August. During the Battle of the Eastern Solomons, the Japanese light carrier \"Ry\u016bj\u014d\" was sunk. The Japanese troops that were supposed to land on Guadalcanal was forced back. \"Enterprise\" was hit three times. 77 sailors were killed and 91 were hurt. \"Enterprise\" was damaged badly.\n\"Enterprise\" was fixed at Pearl Harbor from 10 September-16 October 1942.\nOn 13 November, pilots from \"Enterprise\" helped to sink . When the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal ended on 15 November 1942, \"Enterprise\" had helped to sink 16 ships and damage eight more. \nOn July 20 1943, \"Enterprise\" started being upgraded. These happened over several months. She was given an anti-torpedo blister. This meant that the carrier would be protected more against torpedoes.\nReturn to duty.\n\"Enterprise\" was back by November 1943. She helped the U.S. soldiers landing on Makin Atoll from 19\u201321 November 1943. \n\"Enterprise\" launched planes to strike the Marshall Islands and helped U.S. soldiers land on Kwajalein from 29 January-3 February 1944. Then she went to strike the Japanese base in Truk Lagoon in the Caroline Islands on 17 February. \n\"Enterprise\" launched planes to hit Jaluit Atoll on 20 February. She helped troops who were landing on Emirau Island (19\u201325 March). On 14 April she helped troops to land in Hollandia (currently known as Jayapura), in New Guinea.\nThe Battle of the Philippine Sea.\nOn 19 June 1944, \"Enterprise\" took part in the Battle of the Philippine Sea. For over eight hours, American and Japanese pilots fought. Over two days, six American ships were damaged. 130 planes and 76 pilots and aircrew were lost. American aircraft and U.S. submarines sank three Japanese carriers (, , and ). The Japanese lost 426 planes.\n\"Enterprise\" helped to defend the U.S. ships and to strike the Japanese ships. After the battle, \"Enterprise\" helped with the invasion of Saipan until 5 July. She then went back to Pearl Harbor for a month of rest. She came back on 24 August and attacked the Bonin Islands from 31 August \u2013 2 September.\nThe Battle of Leyte Gulf.\nIn the Battle of Leyte Gulf (23\u201326 October), \"Enterprise\" planes attacked battleships and destroyers. During November, planes from \"Enterprise\" hit Manila and Yap. She returned to Pearl Harbor on 6 December 1944.\nAfter the war.\nOperation Magic Carpet.\n\"Enterprise\" sailed to Pearl Harbor with 1,100 soldiers. She then started sailing to Europe. She brought 10,000 soldiers home. During the Enterprise\u2019s last trip, the ship was caught in very high winds in the Atlantic. The crew almost abandoned ship. \"Enterprise\" had to go back to New York.\n\"Enterprise\" got a British Admiralty Pennant. The pennant was given to \"Enterprise\" as a gift from an ally. \"Enterprise\" is the only non-Royal Navy ship to get the award in more than 400 years.\nThe end of the \"Big E\".\n\"Enterprise\" went into the New York Naval Shipyard on 18 January 1946 to be deactivated. In 1946, she was going to be given to the state of New York to be a memorial. However, this plan was cancelled in 1949. The \"Big E\" was sold on 1 July 1958 to the Lipsett Corporation to be scrapped. Scrapping was done in May 1960. \nSuccessor to the \"Big E\".\nIn November 1961, USS \"Enterprise\" (CVA(N)-65) was brought into service. This was the world's first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier. The was decommissioned on 1 December 2012. Another \"Enterprise\" would be a , CVN-80. \nAwards.\n\"Enterprise\" was awarded a Presidential Unit Citation for her service during World War II. The citation says:\n\"Enterprise\" also got the Navy Unit Commendation and 20 battle stars for World War II service. This means that she is the highest decorated US ship ever."}

People who served in the United States military are buried here. The cemetery started during the American Civil War. It is on a big farm called Arlington House. Arlington House was the home of Mary Anna Custis Lee. Mary Anna Custis Lee was a great-granddaughter of Martha Washington. She was also the wife of Confederate general Robert E. Lee. Although most of the farm now has graves, the old farmhouse still stands in the middle of the cemetery. The cemetery is across the Potomac River from the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C..\nThe cemetery covers . People who died serving the United States in a war, and military veterans are allowed to be buried in the cemetery. People are buried here who fought in wars from American Civil War to the military actions in Afghanistan and Iraq. People who were buried here before the Civil War were reburied after 1900.\nArlington National Cemetery is taken care of by the United States Army. Arlington House (Custis-Lee Mansion) and its land are taken care of by the National Park Service as a memorial to Lee. Recently, the way the cemetery is managed caused controversy.\nHistory.\nGeorge Washington Parke Custis was the grandson of Martha Washington, and grew up with Martha and George Washington. He got the land that now is Arlington National Cemetery in 1802. He began building Arlington House, where he lived with his wife Mary Lee Fitzhugh Custis. The land and house was given to their only child that lived to be an adult, Mary Anna Custis Lee. She was married to Robert E. Lee, a West Point graduate and United States Army officer. When Fort Sumter was forced to surrender at the beginning of the American Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln asked Lee to be the general of the federal army. Lee did not give an answer right away, but waited to see if his home state of Virginia would leave the Union.\nLee left the federal army when Virginia said it was leaving the United States. He decided he could not fight against his home state. He became the leader of the armed forces of the Commonwealth of Virginia. He then became commander of the Army of Northern Virginia. Lee was a great commander and won several battles against the Union forces. Most Union officers thought Lee had broken his promises to the Union because he chose to fight against them. Part of Arlington was taken away from the Lee family and became a graveyard. Mostly Union dead are buried there.\nBefore the Civil War, the United States did not have large military-only cemeteries. Important generals were buried in the Congressional Cemetery with other important leaders. American military cemeteries were needed on distant frontiers, and near battles and hospitals where many soldiers died. When dead Civil War soldiers filled the burial grounds near Washington, D.C., Quartermaster General Montgomery C. Meigs proposed in 1864 that of the Robert E. Lee family property at Arlington be taken for a cemetery.\nDuring the Civil War, people invented tricks to capture or to make life hard for Americans that fought on the other side of the war. The government assessed taxes on properties and insisted that the owners appear in person to pay them. If the plantation owner did not come, the government would sell the land. The government bought Arlington at tax sale in 1864 for $26,800. Mrs. Lee did not show up in person, but rather had sent an agent to pay the $92.07 in property taxes that were owed for the land. The government turned away her agent, refusing to accept the tax payment. In 1874, Custis Lee, heir under his grandfather's will passing the estate in trust to his mother, sued the United States claiming ownership of Arlington. After the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 5-4 in Lee's favor in \"United States v. Lee\", deciding that Arlington had been taken illegally, Congress returned the land to him. The next year, Custis Lee sold it back to the government for $150,000. Custis Lee and Robert Todd Lincoln, Secretary of War and son of President Lincoln, were both present when the property was officially turned over to the government.\nIn 2011, Hurricane Irene killed six large trees at the cemetery. The 220-year-old \"Arlington Oak\" fell down near the grave of John F. Kennedy.\nSections.\nArlington National Cemetery is divided into 70 sections, with some sections in the southeast part of the cemetery saved for future use. Section 60, in the southeast part of the cemetery, is the burial ground for military personnel killed in the Iraq War and the War in Afghanistan. In 2005, Arlington National Cemetery bought another from the National Park Service, along with from the Department of Defense that was part of Fort Myer and that is the site of the Navy Annex.\nSection 21, also known as the Nurses Section, is the area of Arlington National Cemetery where many nurses are buried. The Nurses Memorial is there. In the cemetery, there is a Confederate section with graves of soldiers of the Confederate States of America and a Confederate Memorial. All Confederate headstones are peaked rather than rounded. In Section 27, there are buried more than 3,800 former slaves, called \"Contrabands\" during the Civil War. Their headstones are designated with the word \"Civilian\" or \"Citizen\".\nGrave markers, niches and headstones.\nThe United States Department of Veterans Affairs takes care of the National Cemetery Administration's requests for the words and faith emblems (a cross, Jewish star, etc.) at no charge to the family of the dead put on upright marble headstones or columbarium niche covers. There are 39 authorized faith emblems available for placement to represent the deceased's faith. See also, the United States Department of Veterans Affairs webpage \"Available Emblems of Belief for Placement on Government Headstones\" and \"Markers\" Markers\nThe cemetery had allowed privately-purchased markers in certain burial areas. Since 2001, the areas that the cemetery permitted such markers in are filled. The older sections of the cemetery have many different private markers, including artillery pieces.\nTomb of the Unknowns.\nThe Tomb of the Unknowns at Arlington National Cemetery is also called the \"Tomb of the Unknown Soldier\". It stands on top of a hill overlooking Washington, D.C. It honors soldiers who died without their bodies being identified.\nThe Tomb is one of the more popular sites at the Cemetery. The tomb is made from Yule marble quarried in Colorado. It consists of seven pieces, with a total weight of 79 short tons (72 metric tons). The tomb was completed and opened to the public April 9, 1932, at a cost of $48,000.\nU.S. Army guards have stood watch at the Tomb of the Unknowns at all times since July 2, 1937. The 3rd U.S. Infantry Regiment (\"The Old Guard\") began guarding the Tomb April 6, 1948.\nArlington Memorial Amphitheater.\nThe Tomb of the Unknowns is part of the Arlington Memorial Amphitheater. The Memorial Amphitheater has hosted state funerals and Memorial Day and Veterans Day ceremonies. Ceremonies are also held for Easter. About 5,000 people attend these holiday ceremonies each year. The structure is mostly built of Imperial Danby marble from Vermont. The Memorial Display room, between the amphitheater and the Tomb of the Unknowns, uses Botticino stone, imported from Italy. The amphitheater was the result of a campaign by Ivory Kimball to construct a place to honor America's soldiers. Congress authorized the structure March 4, 1913. Woodrow Wilson laid the cornerstone for the building on October 15, 1915. The cornerstone contained 15 items including a Bible and a copy of the Constitution.\nNetherlands Carillon.\nThe Netherlands Carillon is a carillon (bell tower) that was a gift from the Netherlands to the people of the United States in 1954, in thanks for their efforts during World War II. The bells are played by people with special training. This happens regularly during the summer and on special days. Recorded tunes are played on the hour and during the day. It is next to Arlington National Cemetery, on the north side.\nMemorials.\nIt is now hard to find space to build new memorials at the cemetery. The army worries that new memorials take up space that could otherwise be used for graves. The army requires a joint or concurrent resolution from Congress before it will place new memorials onto the cemetery grounds. Still, there are several memorials on the cemetery grounds, and groups regularly ask for space for new memorials.\nThe Space Shuttle \"Challenger\" Memorial was dedicated on May 20, 1986, in memory of the crew of flight STS-51-L, who died during launch on January 28, 1986. Written on the back of the stone is the text of the John Gillespie Magee, Jr. poem \"High Flight\". Although many remains were identified and returned to the families for private burial, some were not, and were laid to rest under the marker. Two of the crew members, Scobee and Smith, are buried in Arlington, as well. There is a similar memorial to those who died when the Shuttle \"Columbia\" broke apart during reentry on February 1, 2003. It was dedicated on the first anniversary of the disaster. Astronauts Laurel Clark, David Brown and Michael Anderson are also buried in Arlington.\nThe Cairn, the Lockerbie memorial is a memorial to the 270 killed in the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland. The memorial is made up of 270 stones, one for each person killed in the disaster. In section 64, there is a memorial to the 184 victims of the September 11 attacks on the Pentagon. The memorial takes the shape of a pentagon, and lists the names of all the victims that were killed.\nThere are only two mausoleums located within the confines of the cemetery. One is for the family of General Nelson Appleton Miles in Section 3 and the other one belongs to the family of General Thomas Crook Sullivan and it is in Section 1.\nThere is a Commonwealth Cross of Sacrifice with the names of all the citizens of the USA who lost their lives fighting in the Canadian forces during the Korean War and the two world wars.\nThe \"Women in Military Service for America Memorial\" is at the Ceremonial Entrance to Arlington National Cemetery.\nNotable burials.\nThe first soldier to be buried in Arlington was Private William Henry Christman of Pennsylvania on May 13, 1864.\nNotable civilians.\nWhether or not they were wartime service members, U.S. presidents are eligible to be buried at Arlington, since they oversaw the armed forces as commanders-in-chief.\nFour state funerals have been held at Arlington: those of Presidents William Howard Taft and John F. Kennedy, that of General John J. Pershing, and that of U.S. Senator Edward M. Kennedy.\nMilitary burials.\nAs of May 2006, there were 367 Medal of Honor recipients buried in Arlington National Cemetery. Nine of these recipients are Canadians.\nBurial under protest.\nWarrant Officer Gregory S. Crandall's helicopter was shot down over Savannakhet province, Laos, on February 18, 1971. In May of that year the military listed him KIA. According to Arlington National cemetery records John Manning, chief of the Army's Mortuary Affairs Branch stated that witnesses to the crash reported that the ...\"helicopter burst into flames and exploded when it hit the ground.\". It was also reported that there were a series of seven explosions. The remains of Crandall and two other soldiers were recovered in February 1991 and on September 17, 1993, with full military honors, a full sized steel casket, and at the protest of the family, the remains of Warrant Officer Gregory S. Crandall, a single No. 4 maxillary premolar tooth, was buried."}

An official definition is \"the preference for inward or outward rotation of substituents in conrotatory\nor disrotatory electrocyclic reactions.\" In other words, a chemical reaction is torquoselective if the groups of atoms that hang from a ring of atoms are more likely to have rotated in a particular direction during the reaction (instead of being equally likely to rotate in both possible directions.) Torquoselectivity is different from the normal diastereoselectivity of pericyclic reactions. Instead it is more selectivity beyond the Woodward\u2013Hoffmann rules. The name comes from the idea that the substituents in an electrocyclization appear to rotate during the reaction. The reaction produces a single product because only one direction of rotation was allowed (that is, the direction of rotation on the substituents was favored). The concept was originally developed by Kendall N. Houk.\nWhen a chemical reaction closes a ring, its torquoselectivity is the same as enantioselectivity. A single enantiomer of a cyclization product is formed from the selective ring closure of the starting material. In a typical electrocyclic ring closing, selection for either conrotatory or disrotatory reactions modes still produces two enantiomers. Torquoselectivity is a discrimination \"between\" these possible enantiomers that requires asymmetric induction.\nTorquoselectivity also happens in selective electrocyclic reactions that break open rings. The different directions of rotation produce distinct structural isomers. In these cases, steric strain is often the driving force for the selectivity. Studies have shown that the selectivity can also be changed by the presence of electron donating and electron withdrawing groups.\nTorquoselectivity can also apply to other mechanisms, including chiral Lewis acid catalysts, induction by neighboring stereocenters (in which case the torquoselectivity is a case of diastereoselectivity), and axial-to-tetrahedral chirality transfer. An example of axial-to-tetrahedral chirality transfer is shown below for the torquoselective Nazarov cyclization reaction of a chiral allenyl vinyl ketone. "}

They have flattened bodies and wide pectoral fins, which make them look similar to rays. Twenty-three species are known. \nThe genus is the only one in its family, Squatinidae, and order Squatiniformes. They are worldwide in temperate and tropical seas. Most species are in shallow temperate or tropical seas, but one species is found in deeper water, down to 1,300 metres. Angelsharks are specialised for a kind of predation which is unusual for sharks.\nThey are ambush predators. They have extensible jaws with long, needle-like teeth. They quickly snap upwards to capture prey. They bury themselves in sand or mud lying in wait for their prey, which includes fish, crustaceans, and many different types of mollusks. \nDiscription and biology.\nThe front part of the angel sharks' bodies are wide and flattened, but the back part is more muscular. The eyes and spiracles are on the top, and the five gill slits are on its back. Both the pectoral fins and the pelvic fins are large and are held horizontally. There are two dorsal fins, no anal fin. Unusually for sharks, the lower lobe of the caudal fin is longer than the upper lobe. Most types of angel sharks grow to a length of about 1.5 metres: the Japanese angelshark reaches two metres. They are ovoviviparous, and can have up to 13 pups at a time.\nBehavior.\nAlthough angelsharks are bottom dwellers and appear harmless, they can give painful bites if provoked, due to their powerful jaws and sharp teeth. Angelsharks may bite if a diver approaches the head or grabs the tail. "}

It has a noticeably long head, tiny eyes and five short gill openings. The mouth is large and parabolic in shape. Its body is soft and flabby. This shark has a long caudal fin without a ventral lobe. The pectoral fins are short and wide, and the two dorsal fins are small, round and equal in size. The anal fin is round and smaller than the dorsal fins, while the pelvic fins are larger than the dorsals. The Goblin shark has a long extendable jaw, with long, thin teeth. The shape of its body shows that the Goblin shark is a slow moving species of shark.\nLiving Goblin sharks are a pinkish-white color with bluish fins. Specimens fade and become a brownish color when preserved in alcohol. \nGoblin sharks have 26 long, thin, spike-like teeth on their upper jaw and 24 on their lower jaw. They have three rows of front teeth on each side of both jaws. The teeth in the front upper jaw are separated from the smaller upper side teeth by a gap.\nMature male Goblin sharks have been found to reach lengths ranching from 8.66 to 12.6 feet (2.6 to 3.8 meters) long. Mature females have been found to reach lengths ranging from 11 to 12.2 feet (3.4 to 3.7 meters). The size at birth is not known, but the smallest specimen found was 3.51 feet (1.07 meters) long. The heaviest Goblin shark found weighed 210\u00a0kg (460 pounds), and was 3.8 metres (12 feet) long.\nDistribution.\nThis species of deep-sea shark is thought to be widely distributed. Specimens have been seen in the Atlantic, off the coast of Guyana, Surinam, French Guiana, France, Madeira, Senegal, Portugal, and the Gulf of Guinea. It has also been reported in the western Pacific off Japan, Australia and New Zealand. In the Indian Ocean it is found off South Africa and Mozambique. It was recently recorded in the U.S.A near San Clemente Island off the coast of California, as well as in the northern Gulf of Mexico, south of Pascagoula, Mississippi.\nHabitat.\nThe Goblin shark is a bottom-dwelling shark that is rarely seen at the surface or in shallow coastal waters. This species is found along the outer continental shelves, upper slopes, and off seamounts. Most specimens have been observed near continental slopes, between 885 and 3149 feet (270 and 960 meters) deep. It has been found in waters up to 4265 feet (1,300 meters) deep, and in waters as shallow as 311 to 449 feet (95 to 137 meters). Records show that the Goblin shark could also be an oceanic species.\nFeeding.\nThe Goblin shark senses its prey with the help of electro-sensitive organs. The jaws are made for rapid projection to help in the capture of prey. The jaw is thrust forward by a double set of ligaments at the mandibular (lower jaw) joints. When the jaws are withdrawn, the ligaments are stretched and they become relaxed when the jaw is projected forward. The jaws are usually held tightly while swimming, and have a function like a catapult when the Goblin shark wants to feed. The front teeth are made for crushing. The Goblin shark feeds on shrimps, pelagic octopuses, fish, and squids. It is also thought to feed on crabs, and deep-sea rockfish.\nReproduction.\nThere is no proper information about the reproduction habits of the Goblin shark. No pregnant female has been found or captured. It is believed that they are ovoviviparous, meaning that the young are born live, but there is no placental connection, instead the embryos are nourished by egg yolk. There is no real information of when the Goblin shark matures, when and how it mates, and how long the gestation period lasts.\nHuman interactions.\nThe Goblin shark is fished commercially off Japan, and is sometimes caught along with cutlassfish off Portugal. Elsewhere, they are taken mainly as bycatch of deep-water trawls and occasionally with deep-water longlines, deep-set gillnets, and possibly purse seines.\nThe Goblin shark is probably harmless, but since it has rarely been encountered by humans it is not yet possible to tell. Although probably common, this species of shark is rarely seen and is therefore poorly known."}

It has a slim, smooth-looking body with large eyes, and a long, cone-shaped snout. The dorsal surface is a dark blue colour, and the belly is white.\nThe largest blue sharks can reach lengths of up to 3.8 metres, and weigh as much as 206\u00a0kg. The shark is found worldwide in temperate and tropical waters. They range from the surface to as deep as 350 metres, and prefer water with the temperature of 7 to 16\u00a0\u00b0C.\nDescription.\nThe blue shark has a slim, smooth-looking body with large eyes, and a long, cone-shaped snout that is longer than the width of its mouth. It has extremely long, pointed pectoral fins, which are usually as long as the distance from its snout to the front of its gill slit. The dorsal fin is moderate in size. It is located closer to the pelvic fins than to the pectoral fins. The blue shark's name comes from its distinct dark blue dorsal surface, and bright blue sides. The belly is white. The colours of the blue shark help it to camouflage in the open ocean. The largest blue shark on record measured 3.8 metres (12.5 feet), but they are rumored to get as large as 6.1 metres (20 feet). Males reach maturity at the ages of 4\u20135 years, when they are at the lengths of between 1.8-2.8 metres (6-9.2 feet). Females mature at slightly older ages from 5\u20136 years, when they are at the lengths of between 2.2-3.2 metres (7.2-10.5 feet). The largest blue sharks range in weights from 204\u2013206\u00a0kg (450-454 pounds).\nHabitat.\nBlue sharks are found worldwide, in temperate and tropical waters. They are a pelagic species that rarely comes near shore. They have been known to frequently swim to inshore areas around oceanic islands, and locations where the continental shelf is narrow. In the western Atlantic they can be found from Newfoundland, Canada to Argentina. In the eastern Atlantic they range from Norway to South Africa, including the Mediterranean. In the Indian Ocean, they range from South Africa to Indonesia. In the western Pacific they are found from Japan to New Zealand. In the eastern Pacific, Blue sharks range from the Gulf of Alaska to Chile.\nBeing a pelagic species, the shark's habitat consists of open ocean areas, from the surface to 350 metres (1,148 feet) in depth. They prefer cooler water ranging from 7 to 16\u00a0\u00b0C (45-61\u00a0\u00b0F) in temperature. They are known to swim in water with the temperature of 21\u00a0\u00b0C (70\u00a0\u00b0F) or greater. When in the tropics, the shark usually swims to deeper water with cooler temperatures. This is common in the tropical Indian Ocean, where the majority of Blue sharks are found at depths of 80\u2013220 metres (263\u2013722 feet), where water temperatures range from 12-25\u00a0\u00b0C (54-77\u00a0\u00b0F). In the Pacific, at latitudes between 20\u00b0N and 50\u00b0N, they are known to migrate to higher latitudes during the summer and lower latitudes during the winter. Their populations remain constant throughout the year between 20\u00b0N and 20\u00b0S latitude.\nBehaviour.\nThe blue shark has one of the largest ranges in terms of depths of the water. They can be found from the surface to the bottom. This type of adaption makes it easy for them to be able to find food. Blue sharks are known to migrate thousands of miles for food and for mating. This species of shark often is not found alone. Instead, they form groups based on their gender and on their size. They are often referred to as the \"Wolves of the Sea\" due to the complex levels of hierarchy that they form within their groups which highly reflects the behaviour of wolves. Due to their territorial instincts and their aggressive behaviours, divers have to be very careful around them. Many of the filmings of these sharks have been done with the divers in cages for the divers' own personal safety.\nFeeding.\nThe majority of the blue shark's diet consists of invertebrates such as squid, cuttlefish, and pelagic octopus, and bony fish such as herring and sardines. They also feed on various types of sea birds, crustaceans such as lobster, crab, and shrimp, and they also feed on carrion.\nThey are very opportunistic when it comes to hunting. They have been known to feed on almost anything that they can find, including prey items which they can find in large numbers such as shrimp. They have been known to feed until they actually can not eat any more. Since they feed on almost anything that they can find, they have been known to feed on garbage and rubbish such as plastic and rubber tires. This can result in the shark falling ill, and even dying.\nReproduction.\nBlue sharks are viviparous, with the males maturing at the age of 4-5, and females reaching maturity at the age of 5-6. The gestation period lasts from 9 to 12 months. During mating, the males have been known to bite the females, but their thick skin is believed to stop any pain. Pups are 41 to 50\u00a0cm (16 to 20 inches) long at birth, with females giving birth to 4-135 pups at a time, but the number of pups depend on the size of the female, with larger females giving birth to more pups. Blue sharks live to up to 20 years.\nPredators.\nPredators of the blue shark include the California sea lion and larger sharks such as the Shortfin mako shark, and the Great white shark.\nHuman interaction.\nRecreationally, blue sharks are considered a sport fish, and large individuals provide a challenge for fishermen. Most commercially caught blue sharks are considered bycatch. It is estimated that 10 to 20 million are killed each year, possibly having a negative impact on world populations. The salmon, mackerel, and sardine fisheries are affected by Blue shark predation on catches, and entanglement in nets. The fins of blue sharks are sold to Asian markets and are used to make shark-fin soup.\nHaving been known to attack humans and boats, blue sharks are considered to be a dangerous species. Twelve unprovoked attacks and four boat attacks have been documented by the International Shark Attack File (ISAF). Three documented attacks resulted from air or sea disasters. There are several accounts where Blue sharks attacked shipwrecked sailors floating in the open ocean. The blue shark sometimes circles swimmers or divers for up to fifteen minutes or more. While not overly aggressive, it is not a timid shark, and needs to be approached with caution, especially if it has been circling, since it may attempt to bite.\nConservation.\nAlthough blue sharks are among the most abundant, widespread, and fast growing shark, they are one of the most heavily fished sharks in the world. With an estimated 10 to 20 million individuals caught and killed each year, there is concern not only about what this is doing to Blue shark populations, but also about the effect the removal of such an important predator might have on the oceanic ecosystem. Blue sharks are one of the most important species in the international shark-fin trade. However, their meat, while eaten in a few countries, is not very popular. The blue shark is listed as Near Threatened by the IUCN."}

It is when an organic compound changes its structure. Two substituents jump from one place on the molecule to another. It is a pericyclic valence isomerization when two sigma bonds move at the same time to a new place on the same molecule. Dyotropic reactions are important in organic chemistry. They can explain how certain reactions work. Dyotropic reactions can be a useful step in making large and complicated molecules. Dyotropic reactions were first described by Manfred T. Reetz in 1971. The name \"dyotropic reaction\" comes from the Greek word \"dyo\" meaning \"two.\" \"Rearrangement\" means that the reaction changes the bonds between atoms on a single molecule.\nIn a type I reaction, two migrating groups trade their relative positions. A type II reaction involves migration to new bonding sites without positional interchange.\nType I rearrangements.\nIn type I rearrangements (Y-A-B-X conversion to X-A-B-Y), the two migrating groups are oriented trans to each other. The reaction leaves both groups on the opposite sides. The first example of a dyotropic rearrangement involving a carbon-carbon bond was reported by Cyril A. Grob and Saul Winstein. They saw the exchange of two bromine atoms in a certain steroid. \nIn a simple example, the two bromine atoms in 3-tert-butyl-trans-1,2-dibromohexane mutarotate by heating. In the transition state both bromine atoms connect symmetrically two both carbon atoms on opposite sides and the reaction is concerted. Chemists have also investigated stepwise mechanisms in dyotropic reactions. \nIn organic synthesis, an important dyotropic reaction is the conversion of 4-substituted-gamma-lactones to butyrolactones. Type I dyotropic rearrangements also occur around carbon-oxygen bonds. One example is using heat to change RRSi1R3C-O-Si2R3 to RRSi2R3C-O-Si1R3. (This reaction can go in both directions depending on temperature.) Another example is the 1,2-Wittig rearrangement. Dyotropic reactions can also happen with N-O bonds or N-N bonds.\nType II rearrangements.\nType II rearrangements often involve two hydrogen atoms moving along a carbon skeleton. This reaction type can be found in certain transfer hydrogenations. An example is hydrogen transfer in syn-sesquinorbornene\ndisulfones."}

The DA reaction is very useful as it means cyclohexenes can be made with very little energy. Cyclohexenes are used to make complex organic molecules. One of the first uses of the DA reaction was to make insecticides.\nThe DA reaction makes a new hexagonal ring-shaped compound.

It uses mathematics and computers. Theoretical chemistry predicts what happens when atoms combine to form molecules. It also predicts chemical properties (characteristics) of molecules. An important part of theoretical chemistry is quantum chemistry. This is using quantum mechanics to understand valency (the number of bonds formed by an atom of an element). Other important parts include molecular dynamics, statistical thermodynamics and theories of electrolyte solutions, reaction networks, polymerization and catalysis.\nOverview.\nTheoretical chemists use a wide range of tools. These tools include analytical models (for example, LCAO-MOs to approximate the behaviors of electrons in molecules) and computational and numerical simulations.\nTheorists in chemistry create theoretical models. Then, they find things that experimental chemists can measure from those models. This helps chemists to look for data that can prove a model not true. The data helps to chose between several different or opposite models.\nTheorists also try to generate or modify models to fit any new data, If the data can not fit the model, chemists try to make the smallest change to the model to fit the data. In some cases, chemists throw out a model if a lot of data will not fit, over time.\nTheoretical chemistry uses physics to explain or predict chemical observations. In recent years, it has been mainly about quantum chemistry (the application of quantum mechanics to problems in chemistry). The main parts of theoretical chemistry are electronic structure, dynamics, and statistical mechanics.\nAll of these areas are used in the process of predicting chemical reactivities. Other less central research areas include the mathematical description of bulk chemistry in various phases. Theoretical chemists want to explain chemical kinetics (the pathway that molecules combine).\nScientists call a lot of this work \"computational chemistry\". Computational chemistry usually uses theoretical chemistry to work on industrial and practical problems. Examples of computational chemistry are projects to approximate chemical measurements such as certain types of post Hartree-Fock, Density Functional Theory, semiempirical methods (such as PM3) or force field methods.

He was shy and yet he pushed himself to give lectures.\nAdler also \"transferred\" this idea of compensation to psychic training.\nCultural implications.\nNarcissistic people, by compensation theory, hide their feelings of low self-esteem by:\nNarcissistic children try to compensate for their jealousy and anger by fantasizing about:\nChristopher Lasch, an American historian and social critic wrote in his book \"The Culture of Narcissism\" (1979) that North American society in the 1970s was narcissistic.

For every element \"b\" in the codomain \"B\", there is at most one element \"a\" in the domain \"A\" such that \"f\"(\"a\")=\"b\", or equivalently, distinct elements in the domain map to distinct elements in the codomain.\nThe term \"injection\" and the related terms \"surjection\" and \"bijection\" were introduced by Nicholas Bourbaki. In the 1930s, he and a group of other mathematicians published a series of books on modern advanced mathematics.\nAn injective function is often called a 1-1 (read \"one-to-one\") function. However, this is to be distinguish from a 1-1 correspondence, which is a bijective function (both injective and surjective).\nBasic properties.\nFormally:\nThe element formula_5\u00a0is called a pre-image of the element\u00a0formula_6\u00a0if\u00a0formula_7\u00a0. Injections have one or none pre-images for every element \"b\" in \"B\".\nCardinality.\nCardinality is the \"number\" of elements in a set. The cardinality of \"A\"={X,Y,Z,W} is 4. This is written as #\"A\"=4.\nIf the cardinality of the codomain is less than the cardinality of the domain, then the function cannot be an injection. For example, there is no injection from 6 elements to 5 elements, since it is impossible to map 6 elements to 5 elements without a duplicate.\nExamples.\nElementary functions.\nLet \"f\"(\"x\"):\u211d\u2192\u211d be a real-valued function \"y\"=\"f\"(\"x\") of a real-valued argument \"x\".

However, the polynomial function of third degree: \"f\"(\"x\")=\"x\"3 \u20133x is not an injection.\nExample: The quadratic function \"f\"(\"x\") = \"x\"2 is not an injection. \nNote: One can make a non-injective function into an injective function by eliminating part of the domain. We call this restricting the domain. For example, restrict the domain of \"f\"(\"x\")=\"x\"\u00b2 to non-negative numbers (positive numbers and zero). Define \nThis function is now an injection. (See also restriction of a function.)\nExample: The exponential function \"f\"(\"x\") = 10\"x\" is an injection. (However, it is not a surjection.)\nNote: The fact that an exponential function is injective can be used in calculations. \nOther examples.\nExample: The logarithmic function base 10 \"f\"(\"x\"):(0,+\u221e)\u2192\u211d defined by \"f\"(\"x\")=log(\"x\") or \"y\"=log10(\"x\") is an injection (and a surjection). (This is the inverse function of 10\"x\".)\nExample: The function \"f\":\u2115\u2192\u2115 that maps every natural number \"n\" to \"2n\" is an injection. Every even number has exactly one pre-image.

The full title is Re: Colonised Planet 5, Shikasta. British Nobel Prize in Literature-winner Doris Lessing wrote it as the first book in her five-book \"Canopus in Argos\" series. Alfred A. Knopf published it first in the United States in October 1979. Jonathan Cape published the book in the United Kingdom in November 1979. Shikasta is also the name of the fictional planet featured in the novel.\nThe book has a subtitle, \"Personal, psychological, historical documents relating to visit by Johor (George Sherban) Emissary (Grade 9) 87th of the Period of the Last Days\". 'The novel is the history of the planet Shikasta under the influence of three galactic empires: Canopus, Sirius, and their shared enemy, Puttiora. The book is a series of reports by Canopean visitors to Shikasta. They record what happens on the planet which is very similar to Earth. The novel shows the Earth's prehistory, how things became worse, the \"Century of Destruction\" (the 20th-century), and the Apocalypse (World War III).\n\"Shikasta\" uses stories and images from the Old Testament and is influenced by spiritual and mystical themes in Sufism. Lessing had become interested in this Islamic belief system in the mid-1960s. The book was a major shift of focus in Lessing's writing, from realism to science fiction. Many of her readers were unhappy with the change. Critics gave the book both good and bad reviews. Some were impressed by the way the book showed a wide view of humanity and the universe. One reviewer called it a brave \"and disturbing work from one of the world's great living writers\". Others reviewers disliked the novel because it was depressing and humanity had no free will. People's lives were controlled by galactic empires.\nThe story of Shikasta is retold in the third book of the \"Canopus\" series, \"The Sirian Experiments\" (1980). In that book, the story is told from the point of view of Sirius. Shikasta appears again in the fourth book in the series, \"The Making of the Representative for Planet 8\" (1982). The Zones that are briefly mentioned in \"Shikasta\" are the subject of the second book in the series, \"The Marriages Between Zones Three, Four and Five\" (1980)."}

Chemists assume that the electrons will occupy the lowest energy level MOs first. For example, if a molecule has enough electrons to fill 15 MOs, the 15 MOs with the lowest energy levels will be occupied. The 15th MO on the list would be called the \"highest occupied molecular orbital\" (HOMO) and the 16th MO on the list would be the \"lowest unoccupied molecular orbital\" (LUMO). The difference in the HOMO's energy level and the LUMO's energy level is called the band gap.

These terms have different meanings in polymer chemistry. In polymers, side chains extend from a backbone structure, while they are attached to the alpha carbon atoms of the amino acid backbone in proteins. \nOrganic chemistry has rules for naming compounds with substituent groups. The substituent group is listed first with a suffix to describe how it is attached to the main carbon chain. The suffix -yl is used when naming organic compounds that contain a single bond replacing one hydrogen. -ylidene and -ylidyne are used for double bonds and triple bonds respectively. When naming hydrocarbons that contain a substituent, position numbers may be used. These number will indicate which carbon atom the substituent is attached to. One case where this information is needed is that of isomers.\nThe phrases most-substituted and least-substituted are often used to describe molecules and predict their products.

Conjugated systems are created by several multiple bonds, each separated by single bonds. In general, conjugated systems may lower the overall energy of the molecule and increase how steady it is. They can contain lone pairs, radicals or carbonium ions. The compound may be cyclic, acyclic, linear or mixed. In most cases, the atoms in a molecule are held together by single bonds (where orbitals from adjacent atoms overlap). Molecules which have a conjugated system have unique properties different from normal compounds created by the sharing of the delocalized electrons among many atoms.\nConjugation is the overlap of one p-orbital with another across a sigma bond (or single bond) that is in between. (The d-orbitals of larger atoms can also contribute to a conjugated system).\nA conjugated system has a region of overlapping p-orbitals, bridging the single bonds that are between. They allow a delocalization of pi electrons across all the adjacent aligned p-orbitals.\nThe pi electrons do not belong to a single bond or atom, but rather to a group of atoms.\nThe largest conjugated systems (with the greatest number of shared electrons) are in graphite, conductive polymers, and carbon nanotubes.\nMechanism.\nDifferent types of molecular structures can result in conjugation. For conjugation, all the neighboring atoms in a chain must have an available p-orbital. In many cases, conjugated systems are a series of a single bonds each followed by a double bond. Other systems exist. For example, furan (see picture) is a five-membered ring with two alternating double bonds and an oxygen in position 1. The Oxygen in furan has two lone pairs, one of which fills a p-orbital on that position. The lone pair electron makes conjugation possible on a five-membered ring. The presence of a nitrogen in the ring can be a source of pi orbitals needed for conjugation. Also, pi orbitals needed for conjugation can come from substituent groups \u03b1 to the ring like: a carbonyl group (C=O), an imine group (C=N), a vinyl group (C=C), or an anion.\nChromophores.\nConjugated systems are the main things that make up chromophores. Chromophores are light-absorbing parts of a molecule that can cause a compound to have a visible color. Chromophores are often present in various organic compounds and sometimes present in polymers that are colored or glow in the dark. Chromophores often consist of a series of conjugated bonds and/or ring systems, which can include C-C, C=C, C=O, or N=N bonds. Many times, chromophores have aromatic rings."}

{"id": "303000", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=303000", "title": "Lemon shark", "text": "The Lemon shark is a shark that gets its name from its deep yellow back. Its belly is off-white. Lemon sharks are usually eight to ten feet long. They have long, sharp teeth for catching slippery fish. Lemon sharks are common on the southeast coast of the United States of America.\nDescription.\nThe Lemon shark gets its name from the fact that it is yellow in colour. The underside is usually white or a lighter yellowish colour. Besides yellow, the Lemon shark is also brown and olive grey in colour. The Lemon shark is stocky, blunt-nosed, and has two dorsal fins of similar size and shape. The first dorsal fin is low and positioned at the back of the pectoral fins, and the second dorsal is of similar shape and size and positioned at the front of the anal fin. The pelvic fin weakly concave (curving inwards) rear margins, and the pectoral fin's outer margin is slightly convex (curving outwards), and both fins are weakly falcate. The snout is round and shorter than the width of the mouth. There is no mid-dorsal ridge present on this species.\nThe upper teeth are narrow and broad with triangular smooth-edged cusps and finely serrated bases. These teeth get more oblique as they get closer to the corner of the mouth. The lower teeth are narrow and triangular with smooth-edged cusps.\nLemon shark scales are large and overlapping with 3 to 5 ridges. The middle ridge is high, sharp and separated by deep furrows, and the back margins are opposite the primary ridges. The basal plates and pedicels are broad. \nLemon sharks usually range between the lengths of , and have a growth rate of 0.21 inches per year (0.54 cm per year). The maximum length that can be reached by this species is between . Pups are between 24-26 inches (60-65 cm) at birth. \nReproduction.\nThe Lemon shark is viviparous, meaning that they give live birth. After a gestation period of 10 to 12 months, pregnant females enter shallow nursery areas in spring and summer to give birth to litters of 4 to 17 pups. The pups have a very slow growth rate and remain within nursery grounds for quite a long time, where they are in less danger from predators. The mangroves that the young mainly inhabit are highly productive waters, creating an excellent area for feeding, but also an area of very low oxygen content. However, the Lemon shark has many adaptations that increase oxygen uptake, such as blood with an unusually high affinity for oxygen. As they grow, their range increases dramatically, from up to around . Maturity is reached at about 6 and a half years of age, and it is believed that the Lemon shark lives for up to 27 years.\nBehaviour.\nWhen it comes to hunting, the Lemon shark is known to be very patient. They are able to use their yellow coloring to help them successfully hide in their natural habitat. They are often found swimming along the sand of the bottom of the water so they blend in easily. This makes it easy to hide from predators and also to be able to find prey.\nIt is believed that this shark has a special set up with the retina. This enables them to be able to see very clearly even in the murky depths under the water. The Lemon Shark can be aggressive to humans, and is known to have a powerful bite. Most of the attacks that have been noted were provoked, but not all. Since Lemon sharks can blend into their surroundings so well, it is easy for someone to accidentally disrupt the shark.\nWhat is encouraging about the Lemon Shark is that they are able to do fairly well in captivity. That is not usually the case with species of sharks. Still, many experts worry that they won\u2019t copy all they do in the wild in captivity so they don\u2019t usually rely on such details and observations as facts if they can\u2019t also be confirmed in the wild. They are very social, and they develop a hierarchy based on gender and size that is very complex.\nThe Lemon Shark is gentle in nature and doesn\u2019t seem to be aggressive towards people, including divers. They have been known to bite humans but it is believed this is due to being provoked. They aren\u2019t seen as a major threat to sharing the waters with humans. \nFeeding.\nThe Lemon shark's diet consists mainly of bony fish and crustaceans. Catfish, mullet, jacks, croakers, porcupine fish, cowfish, guitarfish, stingrays, eagle rays, crabs and crayfish make up most of the Lemon shark's diet. Also, this species will eat sea birds and smaller sharks. Lemon sharks will eat until full with the rate of digestion dependent on the amount of food consumed at a single time. \nHabitat.\nThe Lemon shark lives in the tropical and subtropical waters of the coastal areas of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. They stay in moderately shallow water, normally going no deeper than 80 meters (roughly 260 feet). They are often found in shallow waters near coasts and islands, by coral reefs, mangroves, bays, and sometimes even river mouths. \nHuman interaction.\nThese sharks represent a small threat to humans. According to the International Shark Attack File, there have been only 10 unprovoked attacks by Lemon sharks, all occurring in Florida and the Caribbean. There have been no fatal attacks from this species. The Lemon shark does inhabit coastal waters which swimmers, surfers and divers commonly swim in. The low number of attacks by this species shows that it is a small threat to humans.\nThe Lemon shark is targeted by commercial and recreational fishermen along the U.S, Atlantic Ocean, Caribbean, and in the eastern Pacific Ocean. The US bottom longline fishery commonly targets this species and it is also caught as by-catch in both pelagic and gillnet fisheries. Their fins are highly prized and are exported to Asia for shark fin soup. Their skin may be used for leather and their meat is eaten by humans. There is some concern that populations in the western north Atlantic and eastern Pacific Ocean are in danger due to over-fishing. "}

They range in length from , and weigh .\nNurse sharks feed on crustaceans, mollusks, sea snakes, fish, coral, and tunicates.\nThe Nurse shark is common in the coastal tropical and subtropical waters of the eastern Pacific and the Atlantic Ocean.\nNurse sharks are nocturnal, and are very sluggish and are harmless unless bothered.\nDescription.\nNurse sharks have two spineless, rounded dorsal fins, with the first dorsal fin being much larger than the second, and they have one anal fin. The first dorsal fin is located over the pelvic fins. The caudal fin is more than one quarter of the total shark's length. The sub-terminal mouth is placed well in front of the eyes, the spiracles are small, and there are long barbels on the mouth. The Nurse shark has nasoral grooves, but there is no perinasal groove.\nAdult Nurse sharks are usually light yellow to dark brown in colour. The young that are up to 60 cm (24 inches) long have small black spots, with an area of lightness surrounding each spot, covering the entire body. Larger young which are 70-120 cm long (28-47 inches) are capable of limited colour changes. Studies show that Nurse sharks kept out of sunlight become slightly lighter in colour, as compared to Nurse sharks which are exposed to sunlight. Nurse sharks with unusally colours (such as brilliant yellow or milky white) have been reported several times.\nNurse sharks have the simplest type of tooth arrangement found in sharks. This means that there is no overlapping between the teeth, and that forward movements of teeth leading to shedding does not depend on other teeth. With sharks that have many overlapping teeth, the replacement of teeth cannot take place until the outer blocking teeth are lost. Young Nurse sharks can replace their teeth quicker than adults. Also, teeth replacing occurs faster in summer, when water temperatures are higher. Averaging 2.2-2.7 metres (7.2-9 feet) in total length, and weighing 75-105 kg (165-232 pounds), adult females reach a larger size than adult males which are around 2.1-2.6 metres (7-8.5 feet) long, and weigh around 90-120 kg (198-265 pounds). Females reach maturity at about 2.3 metres (7.6 feet), and males reach maturity at about 2.1 metres (7 feet). New-born Nurse sharks range in length from 28 to 30 cm (11 to 12 inches), with growth rates of 13 cm (5 inches) and 2.3 kg (5 pounds) per year. Once the Nurse sharks reach maturity, their growth rates usually become much lower. \nDistribution.\nThe Nurse shark is common in the coastal tropical and subtropical waters of the eastern Pacific and the Atlantic Ocean. In the Atlantic, it ranges from Senegal to Gabon, Rhode Island to southern Brazil, and Mexico to Peru. Also, some Nurse sharks have been reported in the Gulf of Gascogne, in southwest France. This species is common in shallow waters throughout the West Indies, south Florida and the Florida Keys. \nBehaviour.\nThe Nurse shark is a nocturnal animal that rests on sandy bottoms or in caves or crevices in shallow waters during the day. They are usually found in groups of up to 40, as they lie very close together, sometimes even piling on one another.\nNurse sharks are very active during the night. In addition to swimming near the bottom, the Nurse shark can move around on the sea floor, using its flexible, muscular pectoral fins as limbs. Large juveniles and adults are usually found around deep coral reefs, and rocky areas at depths of up to 3-75 metres (10-246 feet) during the daytime, and then they migrate into shallower waters of less than 20 metres (66 feet) deep after darkness.\nYoung Nurse sharks up to 1.7 metres (6 feet) are usually found around shallow coral reefs, grass flats or mangrove islands in waters which are 1-4 metres (3-13 feet) deep. They often lie in groups within limestone holes or under rock ledges.\nNurse sharks have been known to repeatedly return to the same caves and crevices in which they have rested before. \nNurse sharks are sluggish, and are not aggressive towards humans and will not attack unless they are provoked. If they are provoked, then they usually bite, but their bites are not deadly.\nFeeding.\nThe Nurse shark is a nocturnal predator, and hunts alone. They feed on fish (such as catfish, mullets, and pufferfish) stingrays, mollusks (such as octopuses, squids, and clams), sea snakes, and tunicates. They move very slowly as they hunt along the bottom. They also consume algae, coral, crustaceans (such as lobsters, shrimps, and crabs), sea urchins, snails and bivalves. \nThe Nurse shark is one of the few species of sharks that can remain motionless in the water when it wants to. This not only helps it to conserve energy, it gives the Nurse shark an advantage when it comes to hunting. As it stays motionless, it's prey usually donesn't notice it, giving the Nurse shark a chance to ambush it's prey. \nReproduction.\nThe mating season occurs once every 18 months, and lasts from the end of June till the end of July. They are ovoviviparous, with the gestation period lasting 6 months. Females can give birth to 21-29 pups at a time. However, sometimes the larger pups will feed on the smaller pups. As a result, only a small number of pups from each litter will live to the age of maturity. The young are born with spots, which fade as the sharks grow older. The average lifespan in the wild for these sharks is from 25 to 30 years. \nPredators.\nAlthough the Nurse shark has no real predator, remains of Nurse sharks have been found in the stomachs of Tiger sharks, and Lemon sharks. Also, there have been reports of Bull sharks, and Great white sharks feeding on Nurse sharks. "}

It is a small species of shark, with an average length of 28-39 inches (70\u2013100\u00a0cm), and reaching a maximum weight of 9.8\u00a0kg.\nThe dogfish is found in the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean, and can be found from the surface to depths as deep as 1,460 metres. The spiny dogfish feeds mainly on pelagic fish such as herring, menhaden, capelin, sand lance, and mackerel.\nDescription.\nThe spiny dogfish has a slim, long body and a flattened head. The snout is narrow, with a pointed tip. The eyes of this species are quite large. The first dorsal fin is located about halfway between the pectoral fins and the pelvic fins. The second dorsal fin is about two-thirds the size of the first one and is located behind the pelvic fins.\nOn the front of each dorsal fin there is a sharp spine attached to them, giving the spiny dogfish its name. The first spine is about half as long as the second spine. The pectoral fins form nearly perfect equilateral triangles, with rounded rear tips, and slightly concave rear margins. The pelvic fins are closer to the second dorsal fin than to the first dorsal fin. One the caudal fin, there is no notch on the upper lobe and the lower lobe is not well-developed. There is no anal fin on the Spiny dogfish.\nThe dorsal surface of the dogfish is slate-coloured and may have a brownish cast. There are rows of white spots along each side, from above the pectoral fins to above the pelvic fins. These spots are more visible on immature spiny dogfish, and they fade as the shark matures. With some individuals, the spots completely disappear. The edges of the dorsal fins and the caudal fin have a dusky-colour at birth, but this colour quickly fades. The ventral surface of the dogfish ranges from pale grey to pure white.\nThe average length of the spiny dogfish is 28-39 inches (70\u2013100\u00a0cm), with adult males ranging from 24-35 inches (60\u201390\u00a0cm), and adult females ranging from 30-42 inches (76\u2013107\u00a0cm). The maximum reported length of males is 39 inches (100\u00a0cm), and females is 49 inches (124\u00a0cm). Mature females can weigh as much as 3.2-4.5\u00a0kg (7-10 pounds), with a maximum recorded weight of 9.8\u00a0kg (22 pounds). The all-tackle game fish record is 7.14\u00a0kg (16 pounds), and was caught off the coast of Ireland in 1989.\nHabitat.\nIn the western Atlantic, the spiny dogfish ranges from Greenland to Argentina, and in the eastern Atlantic it is found from Iceland and the Murmanski Coast (Russia) to South Africa, including the Mediterranean Sea and the Black Sea. In the western Pacific, the dogfish occurs from the Bering Sea to New Zealand, while in the eastern Pacific, this species is found from the Bering Sea to Chile.\nSpiny dogfish are benthopelagic, meaning that they are found just above the bottom of the ocean. They are found from the surface to depths as deep as 1,460 metres. Spiny dogfish can be found in brackish water, but prefer seawater, and are commonly found in waters with the temperature of 7-15\u00a0\u00b0C. Spiny dogfish are found inshore and offshore, over continental and insular (island) shelve, and upper slopes. They are often found in enclosed bays and estuaries. They have been reported to enter freshwater but cannot survive there for more than a few hours.\nPredators.\nSpiny dogfish have been found in the stomachs of cod, red hake, and goosefish, as well as other dogfish. Larger species of sharks, as well as seals and Killer whales also feed on the spiny dogfish. To defend itself, the dogfish curls into a ball, and strikes at predators with its spines on the dorsal fins.\nFeeding.\nThe spiny dogfish usually feeds in groups. They feed mainly on pelagic fish such as herring, menhaden, capelin, sand lance, and mackerel, often consuming large numbers of them. They have been known to bite through fishing nets to be able to feed on the caught fish, usually releasing most of the fish. This has given the dogfish a bad reputation among fishermen. Other food items of this species includes molluscs (such as squid and octopus), crustacea (such as shrimp and crab), jellyfish, sea cucumber, algae, smaller sharks, and shark egg cases.\nReproduction.\nThe gestation period of the spiny dogfish lasts up to 2 years. Spiny dogfish are ovoviviparous, meaning that the embryos develop inside eggs inside the female, and are nourished by yolk-filled sacs. Finally, the female gives birth to 1-20 pups, each one measuring around 20 to 33 centimeters. The spiny dogfish lives to the age of 20\u201375 years.\nHuman interaction.\nThe dogfish poses little threat to humans, but if it is not handled properly, the spines on its dorsal fins can give a harmful wound. Also, the spiny dogfish has earned itself a bad reputation among fishermen due to its habit of biting through fishing nets to get at any fish which is caught in the nets.\nThe spiny dogfish is the most common living shark, yet two populations in the northwest and northeast Atlantic are at great risk due to overfishing. This shark is caught for food, liver oil, and is used to make sand paper, vitamins, leather, fertiliser, and pet food. Between 1900 and 1910, when the dogfish was at its peak abundance, it was estimated that up to 27 million spiny dogfish were caught off the Massachusetts coast every year.\nConservation.\nDue to their long gestation period and the low number of pups they give birth to at a time, the spiny dogfish must be managed carefully. This species is extremely vulnerable to overfishing and is currently on the brink of collapse.\nCommercial fishermen target mature females because they grow to larger sizes than males. The fishing of spiny dogfish increased dramatically in the U.S.A during the 1990s, resulting in the population of mature females to decrease by 75%, leading to low number of pups. In 2001, the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission (ASMFC) voted to extend an emergency action that closes state waters to fish for the vulnerable dogfish. This was in response to heavy fishing that devastated dogfish populations during the 1990s.\nIn late 2000, a fishery management plan for the spiny dogfish began to develop, followed by its approval in November 2002. Federal and state recovery plans are currently in place but are continually challenged. The National Marine Fisheries Service, with new data predicting the collapse of the spiny dogfish populations, closed federal waters to dogfish fishing in July 2003. The spiny dogfish is currently listed as Vulnerable by the IUCN."}

These include defence against predators: if fish swim in schools, it is less likely any one of them will be eaten. Also, it may help a fish find food, and a mate. The school may even swim faster than a lone fish.\nFish generally prefer larger shoals, shoalmates of their own species, shoalmates similar in size and appearance to themselves, healthy fish, and kin (when recognized).\nAny shoal member which stands out in appearance may be targeted by predators. This may explain why fish prefer to shoal with individuals that resemble themselves. This is called the oddity effect.\nSchooling.\nSome fish spend most of their time schooling. Tuna, herring and anchovy, spend all of their time shoaling or schooling, and become agitated if separated from the group. Others, such as Atlantic cod, school only some of the time.\nShoaling fish can shift into a disciplined and coordinated school, then shift back to an amorphous shoal within seconds. Such shifts are triggered by changes of activity from feeding, resting, travelling or avoiding predators.\nWhen schooling fish stop to feed, they break ranks and become shoals. Shoals are more vulnerable to predator attack. The shape a shoal or school takes depends on the type of fish and what the fish are doing. Schools that are travelling can form long thin lines, or squares or ovals or amoeboid shapes. Fast moving schools usually form a wedge shape, while shoals that are feeding tend to become circular.\nSmall fish are preyed on by larger fish, seabirds and marine mammals (Cetacea). Small fish form schools, and may swim with their mouths open to filter feed on plankton. These schools can become huge, moving along coastlines and migrating across open oceans. The shoals are concentrated fuel resources for the great marine predators.\nThese immense gatherings fuel the ocean food web. Most forage fish are pelagic fish, which means they form their schools in open water, and not on or near the bottom (demersal fish). The predators are keenly focused on the shoals, acutely aware of their numbers and whereabouts, and make migrations themselves, often in schools of their own, that can span thousands of miles to connect with, or stay connected with them.\nHerring are among the more spectacular schooling fish. They aggregate together in huge numbers. The largest schools are often formed during migrations by merging with smaller schools. \u201cChains\u201d of mullet schools one hundred kilometres long have been seen migrating in the Caspian Sea. Radakov estimated herring schools in the North Atlantic can occupy up to 4.8 cubic kilometres with fish densities between 0.5 and 1.0 fish/cubic metre. That is about three billion fish in one school. These schools move along coastlines and cross the open oceans. Herring schools have very precise arrangements which allow the school to maintain relatively constant cruising speeds. Herrings have excellent hearing, and their schools react very fast to a predator. The herrings keep a certain distance from a moving scuba diver or cruising predator like a killer whale, forming a space which looks like a doughnut from a spotter plane.\nMany species of large predatory fish also school, including many highly migratory fish, such as tuna and some ocean going sharks. Cetaceans such as dolphins, porpoises and whales, operate in organised social groups called pods.\nSchooling behaviour is generally described as a trade-off between the anti-predator benefits and the costs of increased competition for food.\nSchooling is a classic example of 'emergence', where there are properties that are possessed by the school but not by the individual fish. Emergent properties give an evolutionary advantage to members of the school which non-members do not receive.\nPredator avoidance.\nFish are in danger of being eaten if they are separated from the school. Several anti-predator functions of fish schools have been proposed.\nSchooling forage fish are subject to constant attacks by predators. An example is the attacks that take place during the African sardine run. The African sardine run is a spectacular migration by millions of silvery sardines along the southern coastline of Africa. In terms of biomass, the sardine run could rival East Africa's great wildebeest migration.\nSardines have a short life-cycle, living only two or three years. Adult sardines, about two years old, mass on the Agulhas Bank where they spawn during spring and summer, releasing tens of thousands of eggs into the water. The adult sardines then make their way in hundreds of shoals towards the sub-tropical waters of the Indian Ocean. A larger shoal might be 7\u00a0kilometres (4\u00a0mi) long, 1.5\u00a0kilometres (1\u00a0mi) wide and 30\u00a0meters (100\u00a0ft) deep. Huge numbers of sharks, dolphins, tuna, sailfish, Cape fur seals and even killer whales congregate and follow the shoals, creating a feeding frenzy along the coastline.\nWhen threatened, sardines instinctively group together and create massive bait balls. Bait balls can be up to 20\u00a0meters (70\u00a0ft) in diameter. They are short lived, seldom lasting longer than 20\u00a0minutes.\nThe fish eggs, left behind at the Agulhas Banks, drift north west with the current into waters off the west coast, where the larvae develop into juvenile fish. When they are old enough, they aggregate into dense shoals and migrate southwards, returning to the Agulhas banks in order to restart the cycle."}

It studies them at macroscopic, atomic, subatomic, and particulate levels. It looks at concepts like motion, energy, force, time, thermodynamics, quantum chemistry, statistical mechanics and dynamics.\nPhysical chemistry is not the same as chemical physics. Physical chemistry is mostly a macroscopic or supra-molecular science. The majority of physical chemistry concepts relate to bulk properties rather than to molecular/atomic structure alone. These include chemical equilibrium and colloids.\nSome of the relationships that physical chemistry tries to resolve include the effects of:\nHistory.\nThe term \"physical chemistry\" was first used by Mikhail Lomonosov in 1752. He presented a lecture course with the title \"A Course in True Physical Chemistry\" (Russian: \u00ab\u041a\u0443\u0440\u0441 \u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0444\u0438\u0437\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0445\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0438\u00bb) to the students of Petersburg University. \nModern physical chemistry was developed in the 1860s to 1880s with work on chemical thermodynamics, electrolytes in solutions, chemical kinetics and other subjects. In 1876, Josiah Willard Gibbs wrote an article called, \"On the Equilibrium of Heterogeneous Substances\". This paper introduced many of the main parts of physical chemistry, such as Gibbs energy, chemical potentials, Gibbs phase rule. Other important discoveries include Heike Kamerlingh Onnes' work on enthalpy and macromolecular processes. \nThe first scientific journal about physical chemistry was the German journal, \"Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Physikalische Chemie\". It was founded in 1887 by Wilhelm Ostwald and Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff. The two chemists and Svante August Arrhenius were the leading men in physical chemistry in the late 19th century and early 20th century. All three were awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry.\nImportant discoveries were made in the 20th century. These include applying statistical mechanics to chemical systems and Irving Langmuir's work on colloids and surface chemistry. In the 1930's, Linus Pauling and others applied quantum mechanics to develop quantum chemistry. Chemical theories have grown with new experimental discoveries. New forms of spectroscopy started in the 20th century including: infrared spectroscopy, microwave spectroscopy, EPR spectroscopy and NMR spectroscopy.\nPhysical chemistry also improved with discoveries in nuclear chemistry, especially in isotope separation. This happened around the time before and during World War II. Chemists discovered important facts in astrochemistry.\nJournals.\nThese journals cover physical chemistry:\nA historical journal that covered both chemistry and physics was Annales de chimie et de physique. It started in 1789 and was published under the name given here from 1815\u20131914."}

There, it will absorb almost all ultraviolet light which is harmful to many organisms. The term Ozone depletion can refer to a number of distinct, but related phenomena:\nThe details of polar ozone hole formation differ from that of mid-latitude thinning, but the most important process in both is catalytic destruction of ozone by atomic halogens. The main source of these halogen atoms in the stratosphere is photodissociation of man-made halocarbon refrigerants (CFCs, freons, halons.) These compounds are transported into the stratosphere after being emitted at the surface.\nBoth types of ozone depletion were observed to increase as emissions of Halocarbons increased.\nCFCs and other substances contributing to this effect are referred to as ozone-depleting substances (ODS). Since the ozone layer prevents most harmful UVB wavelengths (280\u2013315\u00a0nm) of ultraviolet light (UV light) from passing through the Earth's atmosphere, observed and projected decreases in ozone have generated worldwide concern. As a result, the Montreal Protocol has been adopted. The treaty bans the production of CFCs, halons as and other ozone-depleting chemicals such as carbon tetrachloride and trichloroethane. The biological consequences of this change in ozone levels may include an increases in skin cancer, cataracts, damage to plants, and the reduction of plankton populations in the ocean.\nEstimates of how quickly the ozone layer will regenerate vary by about two decades. NASA estimated in 2006, that it wil take to 2068 for the ozone layer in Antarctica to recover to the level before human-induced thinning. According to the World Meteorological Organization, the state of the ozone layer over Antarctica will not change noticeably in the next twenty years. The state before 1980 will be reached between 2060 and 2075, 25 years later than predicted in 2002. Over the Arctic, there will be bigger losses in ozone over the next fifteen years, esp. in cold winters. For the Arctic regions, the state before 1980 will be reached around 2050."}

Since a photon's energy is inversely proportional to its wavelength, electromagnetic waves with the energy of visible light or higher, such as ultraviolet light, x-rays and gamma rays are usually involved in such reactions.\nOne example where this is used is the Light-dependent reaction of photosynthesis. Far more enegetic photons of ultraviolet light (240 nm and shorter) can break the bonds of oxygen molecules. The newly independent oxygen atoms create ozone in the ozone layer."}

More generally, it is the force that pulls objects towards each other. If we describe for each point in space the direction and strength of the earth's pull, we will get a gravity vector field for the Earth. \nThe theory dealing with electricity and magnetism in physics is called electromagnetism. One of the basic assumptions is that there are two vector fields in all space which govern electric and magnetic forces.

It is in the Upper Rhine valley on the tourist routes of the \"Baden Asparagus Route\" () and the \"Bertha Benz Memorial Route\". The town is known for its motor racing circuit, the Hockenheimring.\nHockenheim is one of the six largest towns in the Rhein-Neckar-Kreis district. Since 1999, the population has exceeded the 20,000, and Hockenheim received the status of a regional central town () in 2001.\nGeography.\nLocation and environment.\nHockenheim is in the Upper Rhine valley. It is on an old trade route that ran from Frankfurt to Basel. The river Kraichbach flows through the town, and divides Hockenheim in an eastern and a western area. Hockenheim covers 34.84\u00a0km\u00b2. About 28.2\u00a0percent is used for settlement and transportation. About 47.5\u00a0percent is used for agriculture. About 2.3\u00a0percent of the area are waterways, and 21.1\u00a0percent are forests.\nThe town is divided into two large natural areas. The \"Rheinaue\" to the west and the \"Niederterrasse\" to the east. The \"Hockenheimer Rheinbogen\" is an area of the Rhine. 656\u00a0hectares of the area is a nature conservation.\nTown structure.\nThe central urban area forms one unit. It is divided into five districts for statistical reasons.\nHistory.\nIn 1984, an old brick kiln was found during an excavation in Hockenheim. The kiln had stamped bricks inside it from the Roman Empire. The Roman Legio XIV Gemina was near Mainz from 71\u00a0AD until 92\u00a0AD. The bricks indicate an early settlement in the Hockenheim area.\nHockenheim was first mentioned 769 as \"Ochinheim\" in a document of the Lorsch Codex (a list of early monastery gifts). The name \"Hockenheim\" was first used in official documents in 1238. During the Middle Ages, Hockenheim was owned by several local authorities.\nIn the 17th century, Hockenheim was severely destroyed twice by French troops. In 1644 during the Thirty Years' War, and in 1674 during the Franco-Dutch War. Tobacco was brought to the area by the French. During this time, the growing of hops started to be replaced with tobacco. In 1803 Hockenheim was merged into Baden. The tobacco crop grew well and prospered, and Hockenheim was awarded town rights on 22 July 1895.\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, asparagus growing replaced most of the remaining hops growing. On 29 May 1932 the Hockenheimring opened with a motorcycle race. In January 1973, Hockenheim was assigned to the new Rhein-Neckar-Kreis (district).\nPolitics.\nThe town is led by the Lord Mayor (). The Lord Mayer is elected every 8 years by the population. This office has been held by Dieter Gummer (SPD) since 2004. The local council of Hockenheim consists of 22 members, and the Lord Mayor presiding the council.\nIn 1975 the Hockenheim government agreed upon a municipal association () with the neighboring villages Altlu\u00dfheim, Neulu\u00dfheim and Reilingen.\nCoat of arms.\nAdopted in 1609, the coat of arms of Hockenheim has diagonally crossed silver hooks in a sign, below a crowned golden lion. The lion is the animal of the Electorate of the Palatinate, to which Hockenheim belonged; the hooks are probably derived from the place name. The form of the symbols was changed several times, but has been specified in its current form by municipal law since 1895.\nSport.\nThe Hockenheimring, a motor racing course built in 1932. It has become on of the two home circuits of the Formula One German Grand Prix (the other is the N\u00fcrburgring). It has hosted this F1 event over 30 times since 1970.\nPlaces of interest.\nA museum for tobacco cultivation (growing) was founded in 1984. It was the first of its kind in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. The motorsport museum opened near the Hockenheimring in 1986 with over 200 historical motorcycles and engines. The was created in 1991 to host the State Horticultural Show. With an area of 16 ha, Hockenheim's largest park.\nThe town's water tower was built in 1910 in Art Nouveau. It is the landmark of the town. Other historic buildings include the Protestant town church, a 1906 Neo-baroque building by architect Hermann Behaghel, and the 1910 Catholic church, done in Art Nouveau with a high tower, by Johannes Schroth. The old Catholic church (1817), with a late Gothic choir tower in classical hall construction, serves as a community center today.\nInternational relations.\nHockenheim is twinned with:"}

He has Native American ancestry. His mother left him at a very young age, but later in life he was able to meet her. She was working as a dog groomer at this point. She ended up leaving him again due to her troubles with addiction. He was raised by his father who also had a drug problem but later became a born again Christian, and sober. Around this time his father also became the president of a motorcycle club. \nRadke grew up very poor. Focusing was a struggle for him during school. He often wore girls' jeans with his friend Mich because his favorite skateboarders wore similar clothes. Ronald has stated that he got them mostly from girls' houses. \nHe learned to skateboard, and he can still ride to this day. In high school, he was bullied by the kids for his unique style of wearing tight clothes and very small shirts. Despite this he also got along with some of his classmates because of his interest in rapping. Radke dropped out of high school twice.\nRadke started forming bands during his high school years. His first band was called 3.0. The logo of this band was made in Microsoft Paint and resembled the Ninja Turtles logo. His second band, named Lefty (with Robert Ortiz), competed in the high school talent contest. While on stage, Radke's microphone fell and Max Green (who was in a band called Almost Heroes at the time) picked it up for him and they almost instantly became friends. Together, they formed a band called True Story. Their interest shifted out of the pop punk scene and got into bands like Trice. Radke started playing piano and guitar. He played left-handed guitar, but still played a normal right-handed guitar when he played Blink 182 songs. At age 21, Radke along with Max Green founded the band Escape the Fate. He made two albums with the band and two EPs. The more popular was \"Dying Is Your Latest Fashion\",it was released September 26, 2006. In late 2008 Radke left Escape the Fate.

He was from Oakville, Alabama and moved to Cleveland, Ohio. He won four NCAA Championships in 1935 and 1936. At the 1936 Summer Olympics, he won gold medals in the 100m, 200m, long jump and 4x100 relay. He died of lung cancer in Tucson, Arizona. \nEarly years.\nOwens was born in Oakville, Alabama and moved to Cleveland, Ohio when he was nine years old as the seventh of the eleven children of Henry and Emma Owens. Owens was the grandson of a slave and the son of a sharecropper. He was often sick with what his mother reportedly called \"the devil's cold\". He was given the name \"Jesse\" by a teacher in Cleveland who did not understand his accent when the young boy said he was called \"J.C.\" \nThroughout his life Owens attributed the success of his athletic career to the encouragement of Charles Riley, his junior-high track coach at Fairview Junior High, who had picked him off the playground and put him on the track team (see also Harrison Dillard, a Cleveland athlete inspired by Owens). Since Jesse worked in a shoe repair shop after school, Riley allowed Jesse to practice before school instead. \nOwens first came to national attention when, as a student of East Technical High School in Cleveland, Ohio, he tied the world record of 9.4 seconds in the 100-yard dash and long-jumped 24 feet 9 1/2 inches (7.56 m) at the 1933 National High School Championship in Chicago.\nNCAA.\nOwens attended Ohio State University only after employment was found for his father, ensuring the family could be supported. He was affectionately known as the \"Buckeye Bullet\" and won a record eight individual NCAA championships, four each in 1935 and 1936. The record of four golds at the NCAA has only been equaled by Xavier Carter, in 2006, although his titles included relay medals too.\nOwens's greatest achievement came in a span of 45 minutes on May 25, 1935 at the Big Ten meet in Ann Arbor, Michigan, where he set four world records. He tied the world record for the 100 yard (91 m) dash (9.4 seconds) and set world records in the long jump (26 feet 8\u00bc inches (8.13 m), a world record that would last 25 years), 220 yard (201 m) dash (20.3 seconds), and the 220 yard low hurdles (22.6 seconds to become the first person to break 23 seconds). This incredible feat is widely considered one of the most amazing athletic achievements of all time. In fact, in 2005 both NBC sports announcer, Bob Costas, and University of Central Florida Professor of Sports History, Richard C. Crepeau chose this as the most impressive athletic achievement since 1850. \nJesse Owens Memorial Stadium was completed in 2001 on The Ohio State University campus. It is a multi-sport facility that hosts the university's varsity track and field, lacrosse and soccer teams.\nBerlin Olympics.\nIn 1936 Owens arrived in Berlin to compete for the United States in the Summer Olympics. Adolf Hitler was using the games to show the world a resurgent Nazi Germany. He and other government officials had high hopes German athletes would dominate the games with victories. Meanwhile, Nazi propaganda promoted concepts of \"Aryan racial superiority\" and depicted ethnic Africans as inferior. \nOwens surprised many by winning four gold medals: On August 3 1936 the 100m sprint, defeating Ralph Metcalfe; on August 4, the long jump, after friendly and helpful advice from German competitor Lutz Long; on August 5, the 200m dash; and, after he was added to the 4 x 100m relay team, his fourth on August 9 (his performance wasn't duplicated until Carl Lewis won gold medals in the same events at the 1984 Summer Olympics).\nOn the first day, Hitler shook hands only with the German victors and then left the stadium (some claim this was to avoid having to shake hands with Cornelius Johnson, who was African-American, but according to a spokesman Hitler's exit had been pre-scheduled). Olympic committee officials then insisted Hitler greet each and every medalist or none at all. Hitler opted for the latter and skipped all further medal presentations. \nOn reports that Hitler had deliberately avoided acknowledging his victories, and had refused to shake his hand, Owens recounted: \nOwens was cheered enthusiastically by 110,000 people in Berlin's Olympic Stadium and later ordinary Germans sought his autograph when they saw him in the streets. Owens was allowed to travel with and stay in the same hotels as whites, an irony at the time given that Negroes in the United States were denied equal rights. After a New York ticker-tape parade in his honor, Owens had to ride the freight elevator to attend a reception for him at the Waldorf-Astoria. He later recounted:\nPost Olympics.\nAfter the games he had difficulty making a living and became a sports promoter, essentially an entertainer. He would give local sprinters a ten or twenty yard start and beat them in the 100 yd (91 m) dash. He also challenged and defeated racehorses although as he revealed later, the trick was to race a high-strung thoroughbred horse that would be frightened by the starter's pistol and give him a good jump. His self-promotion eventually turned into a public relations career in Chicago, including a long stint as a popular jazz disc jockey there. In 1968, Owens received some criticism for supporting the racially turbulent XIX Olympic Games that year.\nJesse Owens was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1976 by Gerald Ford and (posthumously) the Congressional Gold Medal by George H. W. Bush on March 28, 1990. In 1984, a street in Berlin was renamed for him and the Jesse Owens Realschule/Oberschule (a secondary school) is in Berlin-Lichtenberg. His birthplace in Oakville dedicated a park in his honor in 1996, at the same time the Olympic Torch came through the community, 60 years after his Olympic triumph. \nA pack-a-day smoker for 35 years, he died of lung cancer at age 66 in Tucson, Arizona. Owens is buried in Oak Woods Cemetery in Chicago.\nThe dormitory that Owens occupied during the Berlin Olympics has been fully restored into a living museum, with pictures of his accomplishments at the games."}

There was also an audio-only variant, Audio High Density (AHD).\nTechnology.\nVHD discs are 25 cm (9 5/6 inches) in diameter, and store up to 60 minutes of video per side. Each disc is stored in a plastic case, similar to a CED's case, so that the user could not touch the disc itself. The entire case was put into the player, which would take out the disc, and then the now empty case could be taken back out. After one side has finished playing, the disc would have to be taken out, flipped, and put back in to continue playing.\nSimilar to the RCA's CED, the signal on the VHD is recorded by varying capacitance on the disc. However, unlike the CED, the VHD does not contain any groves and the needle is made of diamond instead of titanium. Instead of having grooves, the needle is kept on track electronically so the needle does not have to actually touch the disc therefore resulting in less wear on the disc and on the needle. In one rotation of the disc, 2 frames of picture and audio were read.\nVHD was designed to be very interactive and was used in some video game systems as well as in car engine diagnostic tools.\nHistory.\nThe VHD was first demonstrated in 1978, and after many advertisements in National Geographic magazines, It was eventually released in Japan and in the USA in 1983. However, by this time both Laserdisc and CED were already not selling well compared to the VHS and Betamax VCR systems. As a result of this, JVC did not let the VHD be sold in North America, but made it available to the general public in Japan and commercially in the UK and the US.\nDuring the time the VHD was made, it was mostly used for karaoke systems, anime video games, and interactive training systems. In the UK, the VHD was used for training, demonstration, and fault diagnostics.\nIn Japan, a 3D version of the VHD utilizes double speed discs and special glasses.\nVHDs Today.\nThe VHD was not very successful as a consumer product, but it sold well for commercial purposes. In Japan, the CED is still somewhat popular and the discs and players are both still collected."}

The height of a dust devil can range from a few meters tall to more than tall. They are usually harmless, but occasionally they can cause some damage to both people and property.\nFormation.\nA dust devil forms when hot air near the ground rises quickly through a small pocket of cooler, low-pressure air above it. If conditions are just right, then the air may begin to rotate. As the air rapidly rises, the hot air is stretched vertically and because of angular momentum, the spinning gets much more intense. Because the hot air cools when it rises, it eventually goes down to the base and expands horizontally, while more hot air shoots up the column to replace the lost air. The air that is displaced falls to the ground around the dust devil, creating a balancing force. Thus, a dust devil is formed.\nCertain conditions help the formation of dust devils: \n1. Flat barren, desert terrain: Flat terrain and hot conditions help the hot air \"fuel\" being always available. The dust and sand helps the dust devil be seen.\n&lt;br&gt;\n2. Clear skies or lightly cloudy conditions: The surface needs a lot of solar energy to heat the air.\n&lt;br&gt;\n3. Light or no wind, and cool temperature in the atmosphere: Without a cool atmosphere and hot surface, the dust devil with never form. Wind will not keep the dust devil stable.\nA dust devil \"dies\" when it eventually sucks in cool air from the surface. Cool air destroys the dust devil because it quickly discourages the rising of air through the column. This usually happens when the dust devil becomes weak, or moves across a new terrain were the surface temperatures are cooler.\nSimilarly, when hot air rises rapidly in water bodies and if conditions are just right they are known as water sprout.\nMartian dust devils.\nDust devils occur on the planet of Mars as well. They can be ten times higher than ones on Earth, and fifty times as wide. They can pose a threat to technology placed on Mars.\nHowever, not all dust devils are damaging. Mission members keeping an eye on the Mars Spirit rover reported that on March 12, 2005, a lucky encounter with a dust devil had cleaned the solar panels of that robot. Power levels dramatically increased, and much more scientific work was able to be done."}

This version was created at the latest 127\u00a0BC, when the Temple in Jerusalem was destroyed, and the Samaritans split from the other group in the Temple. As the name says, this version contains the first five books of Moses, or the Torah.\nScholars use the Samaritan Pentateuch when they want to find the meaning of words in the original Pentateuch or if they want to learn about the history of the different versions of the Bible. Some scrolls among the Dead Sea scrolls look like Samaritan Pentateuch.\nSamaritan practices are based on their version of the Five Books of Moses, which is slightly different from the Masoretic text or the Greek Septuagint texts. Some differences are small, such as the ages of different people mentioned in genealogy, while others are major, such as the commandment to only have one wife which appears in the Samaritan text but not in the other versions. (See .)\nSpecial importance is attached to the \"Abisha Scroll\", which is used in the Samaritan synagogue of Nablus. The Samaritans claim it was penned by Abishua, great-grandson of Aaron (), thirteen years after the entry into the land of Israel under the leadership of Joshua, son of Nun. But modern scholars have observed that the scroll appears to include work by different scribes from different centuries, with the oldest texts dating to the 12th century A.D."}

His company was called The Pacific Fur Trading Company. In the early 1800s, his company was trading furs in Oregon. His fur traders found the pass through which the Oregon Trail passes. He made even more money in New York real estate. When he died in 1848, he was worth over $50 million. Today, his fortune would be over $150 billion. The city of Astoria, Oregon was named for him.

{"id": "303215", "revid": "586", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=303215", "title": "Pi bond", "text": "In chemistry, a pi bond (\u03c0 bond) is a covalent chemical bonds where the orbital path of one electron crosses (overlaps) with the path of another. The electrons have a lobe shaped figure of eight path (see picture). There are two areas of overlap as the paths overlap on both lobes. Only one of the orbital's nodal planes passes through both of the involved nuclei. \nThe Greek letter \u03c0 in their name refers to p orbitals. The orbital symmetry of the pi bond looks the same as the p orbital when seen down the bond axis. P orbitals usually have this sort of bonding. D orbitals are also assumed to use pi bonding but this is not necessarily what happens in reality. The idea of bonding d orbitals fits in with the theory of hypervalence.\nPi bonds are usually weaker than sigma bonds. Quantum mechanics says this is because the orbital paths are parallel so there is much less overlap between the p-orbitals. \nPi bonds happen when two atomic orbitals are in contact through two areas of overlap. Pi-bonds are more spread out bonds than the sigma bonds. Electrons in pi bonds are sometimes called pi electrons. Molecular fragments joined by a pi bond cannot rotate about that bond without breaking the pi bond. The rotation destroys the parallel paths of the two p orbitals.\nMultiple bonds.\nAtoms that are joined by a double bond have one sigma bond and one pi bond. If they are joined by a triple bond they have one sigma bond and two pi bonds.\nA pi bond is weaker than a sigma bond, but the combination of pi and sigma bond is stronger than either bond by itself. The extra strength of a multiple bond versus a single (sigma bond) is shown in many ways. The most obvious is a contraction in bond lengths. For example in organic chemistry, carbon-carbon bond lengths are in ethane (154 pm), in ethylene (134 pm) and in acetylene (120 pm). More bonds make the total bond shorter and stronger.\nElectronic configuration is based on S,P,D,and f -Block.\nS has 2 electrons\nP has 6 electrons\nD has 10 electrons\nF has 14 electrons\nSpecial cases.\nPi bonds do not necessarily join a pair of atoms that are also sigma-bonded.\nIn certain metal complexes, pi interactions between a metal atom and alkyne and alkene pi antibonding orbitals form pi-bonds.\nIn some cases of multiple bonds between two atoms, there is no sigma bond at all, only pi bonds. Examples include diiron hexacarbonyl (Fe2(CO)6), dicarbon (C2) and the borane B2H2. In these compounds the central bond has only pi bonding. In order to get the most orbital overlap the bond distances are much shorter than expected."}

Its name is derived from the Old English \"ceosel\" or \"cisel\", meaning \"gravel\" or \"shingle\". \nIt is a kind of offshore barrier which has joined the mainland with Portland Bill. The lagoon between the chesil and the mainland is called The Fleet or The Fleet Lagoon.\nThe shingle beach is 18 miles long (29km), 220 yards wide (200m) and 50 feet high (15m). The beach and the Fleet are part of the Jurassic Coast, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and the location for a book, \"On Chesil Beach\" by Ian McEwan.\nAt the eastern end of the beach at the village of Chiswell, against the cliffs of the Isle of Portland, the beach curves round sharply to form Chesil Cove. This part of the beach protects the low-lying village from flooding. Westwards the shingle forms a straight line along the coast, enclosing the Fleet, a shallow tidal lagoon. The lagoon is 9\u00bd feet (3m) at its deepest.p99\nThe beach provides shelter from the prevailing winds (from the west) and waves for the town of Weymouth and the village of Chiswell, which would otherwise probably not exist\nVarying with the Bank's unbroken increase in height, to , above mean high water, the size of the flint and chert shingle varies from pea-sized at the north-west end (by West Bay) to orange-sized at the south-east end (by Portland). It is said that smugglers who landed on the beach in the middle of the night could judge \"exactly where they were\" by the size of the shingle."}

There are more than 100 rides in the park.\nThe park was opened on August 16, 2009. In the beginning of the park's operation, many people didn't like it because of long waiting times and being dangerous. Most of the rides were broken, the lines were too long, and many people were hurt not only from riding the rides, but from walking around the park. Three people were hurt when a big sign board fell on top of them.\nThe park currently has six roller coasters. Five of them were opened when the park began its operation while the mine train coaster opened in October 2009."}
